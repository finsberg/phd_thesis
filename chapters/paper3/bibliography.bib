abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study tested whether the simple ratio of ventricular end-systolic pressure to stroke volume, known as the effective arterial elastance (Ea), provides a valid measure of arterial load in humans with normal and aged hypertensive vasculatures. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ventricular pressure-volume and invasive aortic pressure and flow were simultaneously determined in 10 subjects (four young normotensive and six older hypertensive). Measurements were obtained at rest, during mechanically reduced preload, and after pharmacological interventions. Two measures of arterial load were compared: One was derived from aortic input impedance and arterial compliance data using an algebraic expression based on a three-element Windkessel model of the arterial system [Ea(Z)], and the other was more simply measured as the ratio of ventricular end-systolic pressure to stroke volume [Ea(PV)]. Although derived from completely different data sources and despite the simplifying assumptions of Ea(PV), both Ea(Z) and Ea(PV) were virtually identical over a broad range of altered conditions: Ea(PV) = 0.97.Ea(Z) + 0.17; n = 33, r2 = 0.98, SEE = 0.09, p less than 0.0001. Whereas Ea(PV) also correlated with mean arterial resistance, it exceeded resistance by as much as 25{\%} in older hypertensive subjects (because of reduced compliance and wave reflections), which better indexed the arterial load effects on the ventricle. Simple methods to estimate Ea (PV) from routine arterial pressures were tested and validated. CONCLUSIONS: Ea(PV) provides a convenient, useful method to assess arterial load and its impact on the human ventricle. These results highlight effects of increased pulsatile load caused by aging or hypertension on the pressure-volume loop and indicate that this load and its effects on cardiac performance are often underestimated by mean arterial resistance but are better accounted for by Ea.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The normal right ventricular pressure-volume relation was studied by recording biplane right ventriculograms with simultaneous high fidelity pressure recordings in 10 adults found to have normal coronary arteries and haemodynamic function at diagnostic cardiac cath-eterisation. Right ventricular volume was measured frame by frame from digitised ventriculo-grams by a modification of Simpson's rule. The accuracy of this method was tested in a study of 22 human and animal right ventricular casts. There was excellent agreement between calculated volumes and those measured by fluid displacement. The derived regression equations were used to correct right ventricular volumes calculated from in vivo studies. The mean (SD) end diastolic volume index for the group was 62 (13) ml/m2, the stroke volume index was 43 (8) ml/M2, and the ejection fraction was 62 (6){\%}. Right ventricular pressure-volume loops were generated by com-bining simultaneous volume and pressure curves. The normal right ventricular pressure-volume loop was triangular, departing significantly from the square or rectangle of the normal left ven-tricular pressure-volume loop. Ejection from the right ventricle began early during the pressure rise and continued as right ventricular pressure fell. As a result phases of isovolumic contraction and relaxation were difficult to define. These observations show that normal right ventricular pressure-volume relations differ considerably from those of the normal left ventricle, presumably reflecting the different loading conditions of the two ventricles. Unlike the left ventricle, the right ventricle has been largely ignored in terms of the detailed},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Myocardial disarray is an important histological feature of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) which has been studied post-mortem, but its in-vivo prevalence and extent is unknown. Cardiac Diffusion Tensor Imaging (cDTI) provides information on mean intravoxel myocyte orientation and potentially myocardial disarray. Recent technical advances have improved in-vivo cDTI, and the aim of this study was to assess the interstudy reproducibility of quantitative in-vivo cDTI in patients with HCM.\$$\backslash$backslash\$n\$$\backslash$backslash\$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: A stimulated-echo single-shot-EPI sequence with zonal excitation and parallel imaging was implemented. Ten patients with HCM were each scanned on 2 different days. For each scan 3 short axis mid-ventricular slices were acquired with cDTI at end systole. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and helix angle (HA) maps were created using a cDTI post-processing platform developed in-house. The mean $\pm$ SD global FA was 0.613 $\pm$ 0.044, MD was 0.750 $\pm$ 0.154 \texttimes{} 10-3 mm2/s and HA was epicardium -34.3 $\pm$ 7.6$^\circ$, mesocardium 3.5 $\pm$ 6.9$^\circ$ and endocardium 38.9 $\pm$ 8.1$^\circ$. Comparison of initial and repeat studies showed global interstudy reproducibility for FA (SD = $\pm$ 0.045, Coefficient of Variation (CoV) = 7.2\%), MD (SD = $\pm$ 0.135 \texttimes{} 10-3 mm2/s, CoV = 18.6\%) and HA (epicardium SD = $\pm$ 4.8$^\circ$; mesocardium SD = $\pm$ 3.4$^\circ$; endocardium SD = $\pm$ 2.9$^\circ$). Reproducibility of FA was superior to MD (p = 0.003). MD was significantly higher in the septum than the reference lateral wall (0.784 $\pm$0.188 vs 0.714 $\pm$0.155 \texttimes{}10-3 mm2/s, p $\backslash$textless0.001) [corrected]. Septal HA was significantly lower than the reference lateral wall in all 3 transmural layers (from -8.3$^\circ$ to -10.4$^\circ$, all p $\backslash$textless 0.001).\$$\backslash$backslash\$n\$$\backslash$backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the interstudy reproducibility of DTI in the human HCM heart in-vivo and the largest cDTI study in HCM to date. Our results show good reproducibility of FA, MD and HA which indicates that current technology yields robust in-vivo measurements that have potential clinical value. The interpretation of regional differences in the septum requires further investigation.},

The hearts and aortas of 2 atherosclerotic and 2 wild-type control mice were scanned with DPC imaging with an isotropic resolution of 15 $\mu$m. The coronary artery vessel walls were segmented in the DPC datasets to assess their thickness, and histological staining was performed at the level of atherosclerotic plaques. The DPC imaging allowed for the visualization of complex structures such as the coronary arteries and their branches, the thin fibrous cap of atherosclerotic plaques as well as the chordae tendineae. The coronary vessel wall thickness ranged from 37.4 $\pm$ 5.6 $\mu$m in proximal coronary arteries to 13.6 $\pm$ 3.3 $\mu$m in distal branches. No consistent differences in coronary vessel wall thickness were detected between the wild-type and atherosclerotic hearts in this proof-of-concept study, although the standard deviation in the atherosclerotic mice was higher in most segments, consistent with the observation of occasional focal vessel wall thickening. Overall, DPC imaging of the cardiovascular system of the mice allowed for a simultaneous detailed 3D morphological assessment of both large structures and microscopic details.},

  abstract = {Physical forces generated by cells drive morphologic changes during development and can feedback to regulate cellular phenotypes. Because these phenomena typically occur within a 3-dimensional (3D) matrix in vivo, we used microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology to generate arrays of microtissues consisting of cells encapsulated within 3D micropatterned matrices. Microcantilevers were used to simultaneously constrain the remodeling of a collagen gel and to report forces generated during this process. By concurrently measuring forces and observing matrix remodeling at cellular length scales, we report an initial correlation and later decoupling between cellular contractile forces and changes in tissue morphology. Independently varying the mechanical stiffness of the cantilevers and collagen matrix revealed that cellular forces increased with boundary or matrix rigidity whereas levels of cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins correlated with levels of mechanical stress. By mapping these relationships between cellular and matrix mechanics, cellular forces, and protein expression onto a bio-chemo-mechanical model of microtissue contractility, we demonstrate how intratissue gradients of mechanical stress can emerge from collective cellular contractility and finally, how such gradients can be used to engineer protein composition and organization within a 3D tissue. Together, these findings highlight a complex and dynamic relationship between cellular forces, ECM remodeling, and cellular phenotype and describe a system to study and apply this relationship within engineered 3D microtissues.},

Localization is understood as a bifurcation into a harmonic mode. The criterion for bifurcation is reduced to the classical form of singularity of a pseudo `'acoustic tensor''; this tensor is not a material property as it involves the wavelength of the bifurcation mode through the Fourier transform of the weight function used in the definition of the nonlocal damage. A geometrical solution is provided to analyse localization. The conditions for the onset of bifurcation are found to coincide in the nonlocal and in the corresponding local cases. In the nonlocal continuum, the wavelength of the localization mode is constrained to remain below a threshold which is proportional to the characteristic length of the continuum. The analysis in dynamics exhibits the well-known property of wave dispersion. In some instances, i.e. for large wavelength modes, wave celerities become imaginary, but waves with a sufficiently short wavelength are found to propagate during softening in all the situations.},

  volume = {22},
  abstract = {The cardiac muscle architecture lies at the basis of the mechanical and electrical properties of the heart, and dynamic alterations in fiber structure are known to be of prime importance in healing and remodeling after myocardial infarction. In this study, left ventricular remodeling was characterized using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a mouse model of myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction was induced in mice by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Serial ex vivo DTI measurements were performed 7, 14, 28, and 60 days after ligation. Apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy, the three eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor, and the myofiber disarray served as readout parameters. After myocardial infarction, the mouse hearts displayed extreme wall thinning in the infarcted area, which covered large parts of the apex and extended into the free wall up to the equator. Average heart mass increased by 70\% 7-60 days after infarction. Histological analysis showed that the infarct at 7 days consisted of unstructured tissue with residual necrosis and infiltration of macrophages and myofibroblasts. At 14 days after infarction, the necrotic tissue had disappeared and collagen fibers were starting to appear. From 28 to 60 days, the infarct had fully developed into a mature scar. DTI parameters showed dynamic changes as a function of time after infarction. The apparent diffusion coefficient in the infarcted region was lower than in remote regions and increased as a function of time after infarction. The fractional anisotropy was higher in the infarcted region and was maximum at 28 days, which was attributed to the development of structured collagen fibers. Myofiber disarray, which was analyzed by considering the alignment of fibers in neighboring voxels, was significantly higher in infarcted regions. DTI provides a valuable non-destructive tool for characterizing structural remodeling in diseased myocardium.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare cardiovascular magnetic resonance-feature tracking (CMR-FT) with spatial modulation of magnetization (SPAMM) tagged imaging for the calculation of short and long axis Lagrangian strain measures in systole and diastole. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy controls (n = 35) and patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 10) were identified prospectively and underwent steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine imaging and SPAMM imaging using a gradient-echo sequence. A timed offline analysis of images acquired at identical horizontal long and short axis slice positions was performed using CMR-FT and dynamic tissue-tagging (CIMTag2D). Agreement between strain and strain rate (SR) values calculated using these two different methods was assessed using the Bland-Altman technique. RESULTS: Across all participants, there was good agreement between CMR-FT and CIMTag for calculation of peak systolic global circumferential strain (-22.7 $\pm$ 6.2\% vs. -22.5 $\pm$ 6.9\%, bias 0.2 $\pm$ 4.0\%) and SR (-1.35 $\pm$ 0.42 1/s vs. -1.22 $\pm$ 0.42 1/s, bias 0.13 $\pm$ 0.33 1/s) and early diastolic global circumferential SR (1.21 $\pm$ 0.44 1/s vs. 1.07 $\pm$ 0.30 1/s, bias -0.14 $\pm$ 0.34 1/s) at the subendocardium. There was satisfactory agreement for derivation of peak systolic global longitudinal strain (-18.1 $\pm$ 5.0\% vs. -16.7 $\pm$ 4.8\%, bias 1.3 $\pm$ 3.8\%) and SR (-1.04 $\pm$ 0.29 1/s vs. -0.95 $\pm$ 0.32 1/s, bias 0.09 $\pm$ 0.26 1/s). The weakest agreement was for early diastolic global longitudinal SR (1.10 $\pm$ 0.40 1/s vs. 0.67 $\pm$ 0.32 1/s, bias -0.42 $\pm$ 0.40 1/s), although the correlation remained significant (r = 0.42, P $\backslash$textless 0.01). CMR-FT generated these data over four times quicker than CIMTag. CONCLUSION: There is sufficient agreement between systolic and diastolic strain measures calculated using CMR-FT and myocardial tagging for CMR-FT to be considered as a potentially feasible and rapid alternative.},

A new treatment of the level set method allows us to include large density and viscosity ratios as well as surface tension.

  abstract = {An optimized echo-planar spectroscopic imaging sequence is proposed to facilitate spatial mapping of triglyceride and total creatine content in the human heart. The sequence integrates local-look field of view reduction, cardiac and respiratory gating, and dedicated reconstruction steps to account for gradient channel delays, field inhomogeneity, and phase incoherence due to residual motion. The technique is demonstrated in 12 volunteers in comparison to single voxel point-resolved spectroscopy in the septal wall at 1.5 T. Triglyceride-to-water and total creatine-to-water ratios derived from echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (0.48 $\pm$ 0.18\% and 0.06 $\pm$ 0.03\%) and point-resolved spectroscopy (0.52 $\pm$ 0.17\% and 0.07 $\pm$ 0.02\%) were found to agree well. In the septal region, intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.67 to 0.72 were estimated. A relatively weak agreement (intraclass correlation coefficients: 0.34 and 0.52) was found for sectors in the lateral wall due to field gradients induced by the posterior vein and limited sensitivity of the receive coil array in this area. On the basis of the findings, it is concluded that fast spectroscopic imaging of both cardiac triglyceride and total creatine content is feasible. Shimming and sensitivity challenges in the lateral region remain, however, to be addressed.},

  abstract = {In this work we discuss the finite element model using the embedded discontinuity of the strain and displacement field, for dealing with a problem of localized failure in heterogeneous materials by using a structured finite element mesh. On the chosen 1D model problem we develop all the pertinent details of such a finite element approximation. We demonstrate the presented model capabilities for representing not only failure states typical of a slender structure, with crack-induced failure in an elastic structure, but also the failure state of a massive structure, with combined diffuse (process zone) and localized cracking. A robust operator split solution procedure is developed for the present model taking into account the subtle difference between the types of discontinuities, where the strain discontinuity iteration is handled within global loop for computing the nodal displacement, while the displacement discontinuity iteration is carried out within a local, element-wise computation, carried out in parallel with the Gauss-point computations of the plastic strains and hardening variables. The robust performance of the proposed solution procedure is illustrated by a couple of numerical examples. Concluding remarks are stated regarding the class of problems where embedded discontinuity finite element method (ED-FEM) can be used as a favorite choice with respect to extended FEM (X-FEM).},

  doi = {10.1161/01.RES.77.1.182},
  abstract = {Recent studies in humans and other species show that there is substantial transverse shear strain in the left ventricular myocardium, and others have shown transverse myocardial laminae separated by cleavage planes. We proposed that cellular rearrangement based on shearing along myocardial cleavage planes could account for $\backslash$textgreater 50\% of normal systolic wall thickening, since $\backslash$textless 50\% can be explained by increases in myocyte diameter. To test this hypothesis, we measured strains at two sites with different cleavage-plane anatomy in eight open-chest dogs. Columns of radiopaque markers were implanted in the left ventricular anterior free wall and septum. Markers were tracked with biplane cineradiography, and strains were quantified by using finite deformation techniques. Hearts were perfusion-fixed with glutaraldehyde, and cleavage-plane orientations at the bead sites were measured in three orthogonal planes. At subendocardial sites of the anterior left ventricular wall, where the cleavage planes approach the endocardium obliquely from the apical side of the surface normal in the longitudinal-radial plane (-67 +/- 11 degrees), systolic longitudinal-radial transverse shear (E23) was positive (0.14 +/- 0.08). At the septal sites where the subendocardial cleavage planes approach the endocardium obliquely from above the surface normal (44 +/- 12 degrees), E23 was negative (-0.12 +/- 0.08). The differences in cleavage-plane angle and E23 at the two sites were each highly significant (P $\backslash$textless .0005). At both sites, the transverse shear strain accompanied substantial systolic wall thickening at the subendocardium (anterior, E33 = 0.44 +/- 0.16; septum, E33 = 0.22 +/- 0.14). These data are not representative of the behavior in midwall and outer wall sites, where cleavage-plane orientation was not consistently different between anterior left ventricle and septum. Our data indicate that rearrangement of myocytes by slippage along myocardial cleavage planes is in the correct direction and of sufficient magnitude in the subendocardium (inner third) to account for a substantial proportion ($\backslash$textgreater 50\%) of systolic wall thickening. Furthermore, three-dimensional reconstruction of the myocardial laminae and local comparison with maximum strain vectors indicate that for the inner third of the ventricular wall the maximum shear deformation is a result of relative sliding between myocardial laminae.},

  abstract = {Since its coming of age in the mid 1960s, continuum biomechanics has contributed much to our understanding of human health as well as to disease, injury, and their treatment. Nevertheless, biomechanics has yet to reach its full potential as a consistent contributor to the improvement of health-care delivery. Because of the inherent complexities of the microstructure and biomechanical behaviour of biological cells and tissues, there is a need for new theoretical frameworks to guide the design and interpretation of new classes of experiments. Because of continued advances in experimental technology, and the associated rapid increase in information on molecular and cellular contributions to behaviour at tissue and organ levels, there is a pressing need for mathematical models to synthesize and predict observations across multiple length- and time-scales. And because of the complex geometries and loading conditions, there is a need for new computational approaches to solve the boundaryand initial-value problems of clinical, industrial, and academic importance. Clearly, much remains to be done. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to review a few of the many achievements in the biomechanics of soft tissues and the tools that allowed them, but, more importantly, to identify some of the open problems that merit increased attention from those in applied mechanics, biomechanics, mathematics and mechanobiology.},

However, understanding of the extent and functional implications of this architecture has been limited by the lack of a systematic three-dimensional description of the organization of myocytes and associated perimysial collagen. We imaged myocytes and collagen across the left ventricular wall at high resolution in seven normal rat hearts using extended volume confocal microscopy. We developed novel reconstruction and segmentation techniques necessary for the quantitative analysis of three-dimensional myocyte and perimysial collagen organization. The results confirm that perimysial collagen has an ordered arrangement and that it defines a laminar organization. Perimysial collagen is composed of three distinct forms: extensive meshwork on laminar surfaces, convoluted fibers connecting adjacent layers, and longitudinal cords. While myolaminae are the principal form of structural organization throughout most of the wall, they are not seen in the subepicardium, where perimysial collagen is present only as longitudinal cords.},

  abstract = {A linear incremental finite element model is used to analyze the mechanical behavior of the left ventricle. The ventricle is treated as a heterogeneous, non-linearly elastic, isotropic, thick-walled solid of revolution. A new triaxial constitutive relation for the myocardium is presented which exhibits the observed exponential length-passive tension behavior of left ventricular papillary muscle in the limit of uniaxial tension. This triaxial relation contains three parameters: (a) a ``small strain'' Young's modulus, (b) a Poisson's ratio, and (c) a parameter which characterizes the nonlinear aspect of the elastic behavior of heart muscle. The inner third and outer two-thirds of the ventricular wall are assumed to have small strain Young's moduli of 30 and 60 g/cm2, respectively. The Poisson's ratio is assumed to be equal to 0.49 throughout the ventricular wall. In general, the results of this study indicate that while a linearly elastic model for the ventricle may be adequate in terms of predicting pressure-volume relationships, a linear model may have serious limitations with regard to predicting fiber elongation within the ventricular wall. For example, volumes and midwall equatorial circumferential strains predicted by the linear and nonlinear models considered in this study differ by approximately 20 and 90\%, respectively, at a transmural pressure of 12cm H2O.},

  abstract = {The characterization of bone/scaffold composite mechanical properties is essential for translation to the clinic, but in vivo studies require resources and personnel not available to many investigators. Therefore, the ability to predict composite properties could facilitate scaffold evaluation and reduce the number of in vivo studies required. To date, there have been no studies that have used experimental data to formulate a model of bone morphology or that have examined morphology as a variable in composite properties. In this study, a simple model was developed to predict the effective elastic properties of hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffold/bone composites using representative volume elements (RVE) and finite element analysis. While the RVE for the scaffold is clear, the choice of RVE for bone is not. Two bone geometries were generated for the RVE based on data from an in vivo study: a uniform coating and bridges in pores. Three scaffolds were evaluated in order to consider the effects of scaffold material modulus and porosity. Results showed that the bone geometry had little influence on composite elastic properties when compared to experimental error from the in vivo study. The implication is that such properties can be estimated by measuring the volume fraction of bone using a non-destructive method like microcomputerized tomography and the simple RVE model.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jmps.2005.04.008},
  abstract = {The effect of growth in the stability of elastic materials is studied. From a stability perspective, growth and resorption have two main effects. First a change of mass modifies the geometry of the system and possibly the critical lengths involved in stability thresholds. Second, growth may depend on stress but also it may induce residual stresses in the material. These stresses change the effective loads and they may both stabilize or destabilize the material. To discuss the stability of growing elastic materials, the theory of finite elasticity is used as a general framework for the mechanical description of elastic properties and growth is taken into account through the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. The formalism of incremental deformation is adapted to include growth effects. As an application of the formalism, the stability of a growing neo-Hookean incompressible spherical shell under external pressure is analyzed. Numerical and analytical methods are combined to obtain explicit stability results and to identify the role of mechanical and geometric effects. The importance of residual stress is established by showing that under large anisotropic growth a spherical shell can become spontaneously unstable without any external loading.

  abstract = {Accelerated imaging is highly relevant for many CMR applications as competing constraints with respect to spatiotemporal resolution and tolerable scan times are frequently posed. Three approaches, all involving data undersampling to increase scan efficiencies, are discussed in this review. Zonal imaging can be considered a niche but nevertheless has found application in coronary imaging and CMR flow measurements. Current work on parallel-transmit systems is expected to revive the interest in zonal imaging techniques. The second and main approach to speeding up CMR sequences has been parallel imaging. A wide range of CMR applications has benefited from parallel imaging with reduction factors of two to three routinely applied for functional assessment, perfusion, viability and coronary imaging. Large coil arrays, as are becoming increasingly available, are expected to support reduction factors greater than three to four in particular in combination with 3D imaging protocols. Despite these prospects, theoretical work has indicated fundamental limits of coil encoding at clinically available magnetic field strengths. In that respect, alternative approaches exploiting prior knowledge about the object being imaged as such or jointly with parallel imaging have attracted considerable attention. Five to eight-fold scan accelerations in cine and dynamic CMR applications have been reported and image quality has been found to be favorable relative to using parallel imaging alone.With all acceleration techniques, careful consideration of the limits and the trade-off between acceleration and occurrence of artifacts that may arise if these limits are breached is required. In parallel imaging the spatially varying noise has to be considered when measuring contrast- and signal-to-noise ratios. Also, temporal fidelity in images reconstructed with prior knowledge driven methods has to be studied carefully.},

  title = {Maximum Velocity of Self-Propulsion for an Active Segment},
  abstract = {The motor part of a crawling eukaryotic cell can be represented schematically as an active continuum layer. The main active processes in this layer are protrusion, originating from non-equilibrium polymerization of actin fibers, contraction, induced by myosin molecular motors and attachment due to active bonding of trans-membrane proteins to a substrate. All three active mechanisms are regulated by complex signaling pathways involving chemical and mechanical feedback loops whose microscopic functioning is still poorly understood. In this situation, it is instructive to take a reverse engineering approach and study a problem of finding the spatial organization of standard active elements inside a crawling layer ensuring an optimal cost-performance trade-off. In this paper we assume that (in the range of interest) the energetic cost of self-propulsion is velocity independent and adopt, as an optimality criterion, the maximization of the overall velocity. We then choose a prototypical setting, formulate the corresponding variational problem and obtain a set of bounds suggesting that radically different spatial distributions of adhesive complexes would be optimal depending on the domineering active mechanism of self-propulsion. Thus, for contraction-dominated motility, adhesion has to cooperate with 'pullers' which localize at the trailing edge of the cell, while for protrusion-dominated motility it must conspire with 'pushers' concentrating at the leading edge of the cell. Both types of crawling mechanisms were observed experimentally.},

  abstract = {Objective: Impaired systolic function in the normally perfused myocardium adjacent to an ischemic region \textemdash{} the functional border zone \textemdash{} is thought to result from mechanical interactions across the perfusion boundary.We investigated how segment orientation and vessel involved affect regional strains in the functional border zone and whether altered stresses associated with a step transition in contractility can explain the functional border zone. Methods and results: Regional epicardial strain distributions were obtained from measured displacements of radiopaque markers in open-chest anesthetized canines, and related to local myofiber angles and blood flows. The functional border zone for fiber strain was significantly narrower than that for cross-fiber strain and significantly wider for left anterior descending (LAD) than left circumflex (LCx) coronary occlusion (1.23 vs. 0.45 cm). A detailed three-dimensional computational model with a one-to-one relation between perfusion and myofilament activation and no transitional zone of intermediate contractility showed close agreement with these observations and significantly elevated stresses in the border zone. Differences between LAD and LCx occlusions in the model were due to differences in left ventricular systolic pressure and not to differences in perfusion boundary or muscle fiber orientation. The border zone was narrower for fiber strain than cross-fiber strain because systolic stiffness is greatest along the muscle fiber direction. Conclusion: Abnormal regional mechanics in the acute ischemic border arise from increased wall stresses without a transitional zone of intermediate contractility. Perfusion is more tightly coupled to fiber than cross-fiber strain, and a wider functional border zone of fiber strain during LAD than LCx occlusion is primarily due to higher regional wall stresses rather than anatomic variations.},

We investigate the effect of ligand pattern shape on the cytoskeletal arrangements and FA distributions for cells having approximately the same area. The cytoskeleton model accounts for the dynamic rearrangement of the actin/myosin stress fibres. It entails the highly nonlinear interactions between signalling, the kinetics of tension-dependent stress-fibre formation/dissolution and stress-dependent contractility. This model is coupled with another model that governs FA formation and accounts for the mechano-sensitivity of the adhesions from thermodynamic considerations. This coupled modelling scheme is shown to capture a variety of key experimental observations including: (i) the formation of high concentrations of stress fibres and FAs at the periphery of circular and triangular, convex-shaped ligand patterns; (ii) the development of high FA concentrations along the edges of the V-, T-, Y- and U-shaped concave ligand patterns; and (iii) the formation of highly aligned stress fibres along the non-adhered edges of cells on the concave ligand patterns. When appropriately calibrated, the model also accurately predicts the radii of curvature of the non-adhered edges of cells on the concave-shaped ligand patterns.},

This sensitivity is caused by the fact that the mathematical description becomes ill-posed at a certain level of accumulated damage. The ill-posedness can be removed by the use of a gradient-enhanced damage model, In this model, higher-order deformation gradients give rise to a non-local effect, which regularizes the localization of deformation and thus renders numerical analyses mesh-objective. The mesh objectivity of the gradient-enhanced damage approach is demonstrated by the application to two concrete fracture experiments: a double-edge notched bar subjected to a uniaxial, tensile load and a single-edge notched beam under anti-symmetric four-point loading. Both the initiation and the propagation of damage can be simulated. Particularly the latter aspect calls for an appropriate definition of the strain measure which governs the evolution of damage.},

The electromechanical model couples detailed representations of the cardiac cell membrane, cardiac myofilament dynamics, electrical impulse propagation, ventricular contraction, and circulation to simulate the electrical and mechanical activity of the ventricles.

  abstract = {After myocardial infarction, a poorly contracting non-ischemic border zone forms adjacent to the infarct. The cause of border zone dysfunction is unclear. The goal of this study was to determine the myofilament mechanisms involved in post-infarction border zone dysfunction. Two weeks after anteroapical infarction of sheep hearts, we studied in-vitro isometric and isotonic contractions of demembranated myocardium from the infarct border zone and a zone remote from the infarct. Maximal force development (Fmax) of border zone myocardium was reduced by 31 $\pm$ 2\% vs. remote zone myocardium (P$\backslash$textless0.0001, n=6 per group). Decreased border zone Fmax was not due to a reduced content of contractile material assessed histologically, and from myosin content. Furthermore, decreased border zone Fmax did not involve altered cross-bridge kinetics, assessed by muscle shortening velocity and force development kinetics. Decreased border zone Fmax was associated with decreased cross-bridge formation, assessed from muscle stiffness in the absence of ATP where cross-bridge formation should be maximized (rigor stiffness was reduced 34 $\pm$ 6\%, n=5, P=0.011 vs. remote zone). Furthermore, border zone myocardium had significantly reduced phosphorylation of myosin essential light chain (ELC) (41 $\pm$ 10\%, n=4, P$\backslash$textless0.05). However, for animals treated with doxycycline, an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), rigor stiffness and ELC phosphorylation were not reduced in border zone myocardium, suggesting that doxycycline had a protective effect. In conclusion: myofilament dysfunction contributes to post infarction border zone dysfunction; myofilament dysfunction involves impaired cross-bridge formation and decreased ELC phosphorylation; MMP inhibition may be beneficial for limiting post-infarct border zone dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Since the pioneering work by Treloar, many models based on polymer chain statistics have been proposed to describe rubber elasticity. Recently, Alicandro, Cicalese, and the first author rigorously derived a continuum theory of rubber elasticity from a discrete model by variational convergence. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we further physically motivate this model and complete the analysis by numerical simulations. Second, in order to compare this model to the literature, we present in a common language two other representative types of models, specify their underlying assumptions, check their mathematical properties, and compare them to Treloar's experiments.

Several inves- tigators2-8 proposed that the relationship of end-sys- tolic pressure (or wall stress) to end-systolic volume (or some dimension) may be useful in evaluating the contractile state of the heart. Grossman et al. pub- lished an important clinical study" in 1977; many others followed. At the 1980 annual meetings of the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology, at least 11 papers0-21 were concerning the end-systolic relationship between pres- sure and volume, pressure and thickness, and wall stress and normalized volume. Several significant studies2' 39 have also appeared in the past 5 years; a dozen clinical studies have been published. With this popularity, the original meanings of end-systolic pres- sure-volume relation and its parameters (e.g., Emax, m, V0 and Vd) have become ambiguous. Sometimes they were purposely modified to attempt to improve presented their value and other times just to make the measure- ment easy. Whatever the reasons, it seems approp- riate to review these modifications with reference to the proponents' original ideas about fundamental aspects. Isovolumic},

  abstract = {Whereas end-systolic and end-diastolic pressure-volume relations (ESPVR, EDPVR) characterize left ventricular (LV) pump properties, clinical utility of these relations has been hampered by the need for invasive measurements over a range of pressure and volumes. We propose a single-beat approach to estimate the whole EDPVR from one measured volume-pressure (Vm and Pm) point. Ex vivo EDPVRs were measured from 80 human hearts of different etiologies (normal, congestive heart failure, left ventricular assist device support). Independent of etiology, when EDPVRs were normalized (EDPVRn) by appropriate scaling of LV volumes, EDPVRns were nearly identical and were optimally described by the relation EDP = An.EDV (Bn), with An = 28.2 mmHg and Bn = 2.79. V0 (the volume at the pressure of approximately 0 mmHg) was predicted by using the relation V0 = Vm.(0.6 - 0.006.Pm) and V30 by V30 = V0 + (Vm,n - V0)/(Pm/An) (1/Bn). The entire EDPVR of an individual heart was then predicted by forcing the curve through Vm, Pm, and the predicted V0 and V30. This technique was applied prospectively to the ex vivo human EDPVRs not used in determining optimal An and Bn values and to 36 in vivo human, 12 acute and 14 chronic canine, and 80 in vivo and ex vivo rat studies. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) in pressure between measured and predicted EDPVRs over the range of 0-40 mmHg was $\backslash$textless 3 mmHg of measured EDPVR in all settings, indicating a good predictive value of this approach. Volume-normalized EDPVRs have a common shape, despite different etiology and species. This allows the entire curve to be predicted by a new method with a potential for noninvasive application. The results are most accurate when applied to groups of hearts rather than to individual hearts.},

  volume = {2},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Changes in myocardial microstructure are important components of the tissue response to infarction but are difficult to resolve with current imaging techniques. A novel technique, diffusion spectrum MRI tractography (DSI tractography), was thus used to image myofiber architecture in normal and infarcted myocardium. Unlike diffusion tensor imaging, DSI tractography resolves multiple myofiber populations per voxel, thus generating accurate 3D tractograms, which we present in the myocardium for the first time. METHODS AND RESULTS: DSI tractography was performed at 4.7 T in excised rat hearts 3 weeks after left coronary artery ligation (n=4) and in 4 age-matched controls. Fiber architecture in the control hearts varied smoothly from endocardium to epicardium, producing a symmetrical array of crossing helical structures in which orthogonal myofibers were separated by fibers with intermediate helix angles. Fiber architecture in the infarcted hearts was severely perturbed. The infarct boundary in all cases was highly irregular and punctuated repeatedly by residual myofibers extending from within the infarct to the border zones. In all infarcts, longitudinal myofibers extending toward the basal-anterior wall and transversely oriented myofibers extending toward the septum lay in direct contact with each other, forming nodes of orthogonal myofiber intersection or contact. CONCLUSIONS: DSI tractography resolves 3D myofiber architecture and reveals a complex network of orthogonal myofibers within infarcted myocardium. Meshlike networks of orthogonal myofibers in infarcted myocardium may resist mechanical remodeling but also probably increase the risk for lethal reentrant arrhythmias. DSI tractography thus provides a new and important readout of tissue injury after myocardial infarction.},

They have a mixed rheological nature: cells behave elastically or viscoelastically, they can adhere to each other whereas the carrying fluid is usually Newtonian. We report here on a new elasto-visco-plastic model which is able to describe the mechanical properties of a concentrated cell suspension or aggregate. It is based on the idea that the rearrangement of adhesion bonds during the deformation of the aggregate is related to the existence of a yield stress in the macroscopic constitutive equation. We compare the predictions of this new model with five experimental tests: steady shear rate, oscillatory shearing tests, stress relaxation, elastic recovery after steady prescribed deformation, and uniaxial compression tests. All of the predictions of the model are shown to agree with these experiments.},

  abstract = {Examination of changes occurring in the zero-stress state of an organ provides a way to study cellular growth in the organ due to change of physical stresses. The zero-stress state of the aorta is not a tube. It is a sector with an opening angle that varies with the location on the aorta and changes with cellular remodeling. Blood vessel remodeling can be induced by imposing a constriction on the abdominal aorta by a metal clip (aortic banding), which causes an increase of blood pressure, hypertrophy of the aortic wall, and large change of opening angle. The correlation of the opening angle with the blood vessel wall thickness and blood pressure changes in rat's aorta due to aortic banding is presented in this report. The opening angle changes daily following the aortic banding. Blood pressure rises in vessels of the upper body, but that in the lower body decreases at first and then rises to an asymptotic value. Blood vessel wall thickness increases in rough proportion to blood pressure. Vessel diameter changes also. But the most dramatic is the course of change of the zero-stress state. Typically, the time to reach 50 percent of asymptotic hypertrophy of blood vessel wall thickness is about 3-5 days. The corresponding time for blood pressure is about 7 days. The opening angle of the zero-stress state, however, increases rapidly at first, reaches a peak in about 2 to 4 days, then decreases gradually to a reduced asymptote. The exact values of the time constants depend on the location along the aortic tree. In general, the course of change of residual strain is very different from those of the blood pressure and the blood vessel wall thickness.},

  abstract = {We have developed a model of cardiac thin filament activation using an Ising model approach from equilibrium statistical physics. This model explicitly represents nearest-neighbor interactions between 26 troponin/tropomyosin units along a one-dimensional array that represents the cardiac thin filament. With transition rates chosen to match experimental data, the results show that the resulting force-pCa (F-pCa) relations are similar to Hill functions with asymmetries, as seen in experimental data. Specifically, Hill plots showing (log(F/(1-F)) vs. log [Ca]) reveal a steeper slope below the half activation point (Ca(50)) compared with above. Parameter variation studies show interplay of parameters that affect the apparent cooperativity and asymmetry in the F-pCa relations. The model also predicts that Ca binding is uncooperative for low [Ca], becomes steeper near Ca(50), and becomes uncooperative again at higher [Ca]. The steepness near Ca(50) mirrors the steep F-pCa as a result of thermodynamic considerations. The model also predicts that the correlation between troponin/tropomyosin units along the one-dimensional array quickly decays at high and low [Ca], but near Ca(50), high correlation occurs across the whole array. This work provides a simple model that can account for the steepness and shape of F-pCa relations that other models fail to reproduce.},

  abstract = {Living systems can grow, develop, adapt, and evolve. These phenomena are non-intuitive to traditional engineers and often difficult to understand. Yet, classical engineering tools can provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of growth in health and disease. Within the past decade, the concept of incompatible configurations has evolved as a powerful tool to model growing systems within the framework of nonlinear continuum mechanics. However, there is still a substantial disconnect between the individual disciplines, which explore the phenomenon of growth from different angles. Here we show that the nonlinear field theories of mechanics provide a unified concept to model finite growth by means of a single tensorial internal variable, the second order growth tensor. We review the literature and categorize existing growth models by means of two criteria: the microstructural appearance of growth, either isotropic or anisotropic; and the microenvironmental cues that drive the growth process, either chemical or mechanical. We demonstrate that this generic concept is applicable to a broad range of phenomena such as growing arteries, growing tumors, growing skin, growing airway walls, growing heart valve leaflets, growing skeletal muscle, growing plant stems, growing heart valve annuli, and growing cardiac muscle. The proposed approach has important biological and clinical applications in atherosclerosis, in-stent restenosis, tumor invasion, tissue expansion, chronic bronchitis, mitral regurgitation, limb lengthening, tendon tear, plant physiology, dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and heart failure. Understanding the mechanisms of growth in these chronic conditions may open new avenues in medical device design and personalized medicine to surgically or pharmacologically manipulate development and alter, control, or revert disease progression. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The study tested the hypothesis that augmentation of the left ventricular (LV) wall thickness with direct intramyocardial injections of alginate hydrogel implants (AHI) reduces LV cavity size, restores LV shape, and improves LV function in dogs with heart failure (HF). BACKGROUND: Progressive LV dysfunction, enlargement, and chamber sphericity are features of HF associated with increased mortality and morbidity. METHODS: Studies were performed in 14 dogs with HF produced by intracoronary microembolizations (LV ejection fraction [EF] $\backslash$textless30\%). Dogs were randomized to AHI treatment (n = 8) or to sham-operated control (n = 6). During an open-chest procedure, dogs received either intramyocardial injections of 0.25 to 0.35 ml of alginate hydrogel (Algisyl-LVR, LoneStar Heart, Inc., Laguna Hills, California) or saline. Seven injections were made $\sim$1.0 to 1.5 cm apart (total volume 1.8 to 2.1 ml) along the circumference of the LV free wall halfway between the apex and base starting from the anteroseptal groove and ending at the posteroseptal groove. Hemodynamic and ventriculographic measurements were made before treatment (PRE) and repeated post-surgery for up to 17 weeks (POST). RESULTS: Compared to control, AHI significantly reduced LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and improved LV sphericity. AHI treatment significantly increased EF (26 $\pm$ 0.4\% at PRE to 31 $\pm$ 0.4\% at POST; p $\backslash$textless 0.05) compared to the decreased EF seen in control dogs (27 $\pm$ 0.3\% at PRE to 24 $\pm$ 1.3\% at POST; p $\backslash$textless 0.05). AHI treatment was well tolerated and was not associated with increased LV diastolic stiffness. CONCLUSIONS: In HF dogs, circumferential augmentation of LV wall thickness with AHI improves LV structure and function. The results support continued development of AHI for the treatment of patients with advanced HF.},

  abstract = {Chronic heart failure is a medical condition that involves structural and functional changes of the heart and a progressive reduction in cardiac output. Heart failure is classified into two categories: diastolic heart failure, a thickening of the ventricular wall associated with impaired filling; and systolic heart failure, a dilation of the ventricles associated with reduced pump function. In theory, the pathophysiology of heart failure is well understood. In practice, however, heart failure is highly sensitive to cardiac microstructure, geometry, and loading. This makes it virtually impossible to predict the time line of heart failure for a diseased individual. Here we show that computational modeling allows us to integrate knowledge from different scales to create an individualized model for cardiac growth and remodeling during chronic heart failure. Our model naturally connects molecular events of parallel and serial sarcomere deposition with cellular phenomena of myofibrillogenesis and sarcomerogenesis to whole organ function. Our simulations predict chronic alterations in wall thickness, chamber size, and cardiac geometry, which agree favorably with the clinical observations in patients with diastolic and systolic heart failure. In contrast to existing single- or bi-ventricular models, our new four-chamber model can also predict characteristic secondary effects including papillary muscle dislocation, annular dilation, regurgitant flow, and outflow obstruction. Our prototype study suggests that computational modeling provides a patient-specific window into the progression of heart failure with a view towards personalized treatment planning.},

In particular, it is shown that particle diffusion cannot determine the particle concentration profile in this regime of interface velocities (20\textendash{}40 lm/s). Particles are redistributed by a direct interaction with the moving solidification interface. Several parameters controlling the particle redistribution were identified, namely the interface velocity, the particle size, the shape of the ice crystals, and the orientation relationships between the crystals and the temperature gradient.},

In recent years, a number of theoretical models have been proposed to model the process of ventricular growth while little has been done to model its reverse. Based on the framework of volumetric strain-driven finite growth with a homeostatic equilibrium range for the elastic myofiber stretch, we propose here a reversible growth model capable of describing both ventricular growth and its reversal. We used this model to construct a semi-analytical solution based on an idealized cylindrical tube model, as well as numerical solutions based on a truncated ellipsoidal model and a human left ventricular model that was reconstructed from magnetic resonance images. We show that our model is able to predict key features in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship that were observed experimentally and clinically during ventricular growth and reverse growth. We also show that the residual stress fields generated as a result of differential growth in the cylindrical tube model are similar to those in other nonidentical models utilizing the same geometry.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To present a database of systolic three-dimensional (3D) strain evolution throughout the normal left ventricle (LV) in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 31 healthy volunteers, magnetic resonance (MR) tissue tagging and breath-hold MR imaging were used to generate and then detect the motion of transient fiducial markers (ie, tags) in the heart every 32 msec. Strain and motion were calculated from a 3D displacement field that was fit to the tag data. Special indexes of contraction and thickening that were based on multiple strain components also were evaluated. RESULTS: The temporal evolution of local strains was linear during the first half of systole. The peak shortening and thickening strain components were typically greatest in the anterolateral wall, increased toward the apex, and increased toward the endocardium. Shears and displacements were more spatially variable. The two specialized indexes of contraction and thickening had higher measurement precision and tighter normal ranges than did the traditional strain components. CONCLUSION: In this study, the authors noninvasively characterized the normal systolic ranges of 3D displacement and strain evolution throughout the human LV. Comparison against this multidimensional database may permit sensitive detection of systolic LV dysfunction.},

We investigated whether isolated LBBB causes these abnormalities. METHODS AND RESULTS: In eight dogs, LBBB was induced by radio frequency ablation. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed that 16 weeks of LBBB decreased LV ejection fraction (by 23+/-14\%) and increased LV cavity volume (by 25+/-19\%) and wall mass (by 17+/-16\%). The LV septal-to-lateral wall mass ratio decreased by 6+/-9\%, indicating asymmetric hypertrophy. After onset of LBBB, myocardial blood flow (MBF, fluorescent microspheres) and systolic circumferential shortening [CS(sys), magnetic resonance (MR) tagging] decreased in the septum to 83+/-16\% and -11+/-20\% of baseline, respectively, and increased in LV lateral wall to 118+/-12\% and 180+/-90\% of baseline, respectively. MBF and CS(sys) values did not change over 16 weeks of LBBB. Changes in external mechanical work paralleled those in CS(sys). Glycogen content was not significantly different between septum and LV lateral wall of LBBB hearts (16 weeks) and control samples, indicating absence of hibernation. CONCLUSIONS: The asynchronous ventricular activation during LBBB leads to redistribution of circumferential shortening and myocardial blood flow and, in the long run, LV remodelling. Septal hypoperfusion during LBBB appears to be primarily determined by reduced septal workload.},

  volume = {114},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) provides a means for nondestructive characterization of myocardial architecture. We used DT-MRI to investigate changes in direction-dependent water diffusivity to reflect alterations in tissue integrity (trace apparent diffusion coefficients [ADCs] and fractional anisotropy [FA]), as well as indicators of remodeling of fiber helix angles, in patients after myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (35 men, 2 women; median age, 59) after acute myocardial infarction (median interval from onset, 26 days) were enrolled. DT-MRI was performed at the midventricular level to measure trace ADC, FA, and helix angles of myofibers. Helix angles were grouped into left-handed helical fibers, circumferential fibers, and right-handed helical fibers. Measurements were correlated with viability and regional wall motion assessed by contrast-delay-enhancement and cine MRI, respectively. The infarct zone showed significantly increased trace ADC and decreased FA than the remote zone. The percentage of left-handed helical fibers increased from the remote zone (mean +/- SD, 13.3 +/- 5.8\%) to the adjacent zone (19.2 +/- 9.7\%) and infarct zone (25.8 +/- 18.4\%) (MANOVA, P = 0.004). The percentage of right-handed helical fibers decreased from the remote zone (35.0 +/- 9.0\%) to the adjacent zone (25.5 +/- 11.5\%) and infarct zone (15.9 +/- 9.2\%) (P $\backslash$textless 0.001). Multiple linear regression showed that the percentage of left-handed helical fibers of the infarct zone was the strongest correlate of infarct size and predictor of ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo DT-MRI of postinfarct myocardium revealed a significant increase in trace ADC and a decrease in FA, indicating altered tissue integrity. The redistribution of fiber architecture correlated with infarct size and left ventricular function. This technique may help us understand structural correlates of functional remodeling after infarction.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: AL amyloidosis with heart failure is associated with decreased longitudinal myocardial contraction measured by pulsed tissue Doppler imaging. We sought to clarify whether new modalities of myocardial strain Doppler (change in length per unit length) or strain rate (the temporal derivative of strain) were more sensitive than tissue Doppler and could detect early regional myocardial dysfunction before the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF) in patients with AL (primary) amyloidosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ninety-seven biopsy-proven patients with AL amyloidosis were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 patients had no cardiac involvement (n=36), group 2 had heart involvement but no CHF (n=32), and group 3 had heart involvement and CHF (n=29). All patients underwent tissue velocity (TV) imaging, strain, and strain rate imaging (SR) at the basal, mid, and apical ventricle in 2 apical views. With the use of TV, differences in systolic function were only apparent between group 3 (basal mean value, 3.0+/-1.1 cm/s) and groups 1 and 2 (5.0+/-1.3 and 4.6+/-1.2 cm/s, respectively). In contrast, basal peak systolic SR (l/s) showed significant differences among all 3 groups (-2.0+/-0.4, -1.55+/-0.6, and -0.76+/-0.3 for groups 1 to 3, respectively. P$\backslash$textless0.01). Basal strain also demonstrated statistically significant differences among the groups (-19+/-4\%, -15+/-4.5\%, and -8.0+/-5\%; P$\backslash$textless0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac amyloidosis is characterized by an early impairment in systolic function at a time when fractional shortening remains normal. This abnormality precedes the onset of CHF and can be detected by strain and SR but is not apparent by TV imaging.},

  doi = {10.1186/1532-429X-15-105},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Late Gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can be used to visualise regions of fibrosis and scarring in the left atrium (LA) myocardium. This can be important for treatment stratification of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and for assessment of treatment after radio frequency catheter ablation (RFCA). In this paper we present a standardised evaluation benchmarking framework for algorithms segmenting fibrosis and scar from LGE CMR images. The algorithms reported are the response to an open challenge that was put to the medical imaging community through an ISBI (IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging) workshop.\$$\backslash$backslash\$n\$$\backslash$backslash\$nMETHODS: The image database consisted of 60 multicenter, multivendor LGE CMR image datasets from patients with AF, with 30 images taken before and 30 after RFCA for the treatment of AF. A reference standard for scar and fibrosis was established by merging manual segmentations from three observers. Furthermore, scar was also quantified using 2, 3 and 4 standard deviations (SD) and full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) methods. Seven institutions responded to the challenge: Imperial College (IC), Mevis Fraunhofer (MV), Sunnybrook Health Sciences (SY), Harvard/Boston University (HB), Yale School of Medicine (YL), King's College London (KCL) and Utah CARMA (UTA, UTB). There were 8 different algorithms evaluated in this study.\$$\backslash$backslash\$n\$$\backslash$backslash\$nRESULTS: Some algorithms were able to perform significantly better than SD and FWHM methods in both pre- and post-ablation imaging. Segmentation in pre-ablation images was challenging and good correlation with the reference standard was found in post-ablation images. Overlap scores (out of 100) with the reference standard were as follows: Pre: IC = 37, MV = 22, SY = 17, YL = 48, KCL = 30, UTA = 42, UTB = 45; Post: IC = 76, MV = 85, SY = 73, HB = 76, YL = 84, KCL = 78, UTA = 78, UTB = 72.\$$\backslash$backslash\$n\$$\backslash$backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that currently no algorithm is deemed clearly better than others. There is scope for further algorithmic developments in LA fibrosis and scar quantification from LGE CMR images. Benchmarking of future scar segmentation algorithms is thus important. The proposed benchmarking framework is made available as open-source and new participants can evaluate their algorithms via a web-based interface.},

  volume = {31},
  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a shear-lag model and an influence superposition technique to quickly compute the stresses and displacements in 2D unidirectional fiber composites in response to multiple fiber and matrix breaks. Unlike previous techniques, both the fiber and matrix are able to sustain axial load, and the governing shear-lag equations are derived based on the principle of virtual work and the finite element method. The main advantages of influence superposition techniques are that computation is tied to the amount of damage, rather than the entire volume considered and discretization is not needed, removing any uncertainties associated with meshing. For illustration, we consider a row of N (up to 301) contiguous fiber breaks and highlight important influences that N and the matrix-to-fiber stiffness ratio, rho = E(m)A(m)/E(f)A(f), have on stress redistribution. Comparisons with the Mode I plane orthotropic linear elasticity solution are favorable for both shear and axial tensile stresses. The best applications for such techniques are as numerical micromechanics tools in large-scale simulation codes of failure in fibrous composites. The present study is an important prerequisite for simulations and modeling of random fracture patterns, as would naturally develop in a real composite. Arbitrarily misaligned breaks are no more complicated to compute, and we reserve analyses of such cases to future simulation work involving random fiber strengths.},

  abstract = {Mature tissues can often adapt to changes in their chemical, mechanical, or thermal environment. For example, in response to sustained increases or decreases in mechanical loads, some tissues grow and remodel so as to restore the stress or strain to its homeostatic state. Whereas most previous work addresses gross descriptors of tissue growth, this paper introduces a possible cell-mediated mechanism by which remodeling may occur in a soft connective tissue\textendash{}that the kinetics of collagen deposition and degradation is similar regardless of the configuration of the body at which it occurs. The proposed theoretical framework applies to three-dimensional settings, but it is illustrated by focusing on the remodeling of a uniaxial collagenous tissue that is maintained at a fixed length for an extended period. It is shown that qualitative features expected of such remodeling (e.g., an increased compliance and increased stress-free length when remodeling occurs at an extended length) are easily realized. Growth and remodeling are complex phenomena, however, and are likely accomplished via multiple complementary mechanisms. There is a need, therefore, to identify other candidate mechanisms and, of course, to collect experimental data suitable for testing and refining the possible theories.},

Measurements of cardiac function currently provide high-resolution datasets for characterizing cardiac patients.

  abstract = {The stability of the shape of a moving planar liquid-solid interface during the unidirectional freezing of a dilute binary alloy is theoretically investigated hy calculating the time dependence of the amplitude of a sinusoidal perturbation of infinitesimal amplitude introduced into the planar shape. The calculation is accomplished by using gradients of the steady-state thermal and diffusion fields satisfying the perturbed boundary conditions (capillarity included) to determine the velocity of each element of interface, a procedure justified in some detail. Instability occurs if any Fourier component of an arbitrary perturbation grows; stability occurs if all components decay. A stability criterion expressed in terms of growth parameters and system characteristics is thereby deduced and is compared with the currently used stahility criterion of constit utional supercooling; some very marked differences are discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In acute myocardial infarction (AMI), both tissue necrosis and edema are present and both might be implicated in the development of intraventricular dyssynchrony. However, their relative contribution to transient dyssynchrony is not known. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can detect necrosis and edema with high spatial resolution and it can quantify dyssynchrony by tagging techniques. METHODS: Patients with a first AMI underwent percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) of the infarct-related artery within 24 h of onset of chest pain. Within 5-7 days after the event and at 4 months, CMR was performed. The CMR protocol included the evaluation of intraventricular dyssynchrony by applying a novel 3D-tagging sequence to the left ventricle (LV) yielding the CURE index (circumferential uniformity ratio estimate; 1 = complete synchrony). On T2-weighted images, edema was measured as high-signal ($\backslash$textgreater 2 SD above remote tissue) along the LV mid-myocardial circumference on 3 short-axis images (\% of circumference corresponding to the area-at-risk). In analogy, on late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images, necrosis was quantified manually as percentage of LV mid-myocardial circumference on 3 short-axis images. Necrosis was also quantified on LGE images covering the entire LV (expressed as \% LV mass). Finally, salvaged myocardium was calculated as the area-at-risk minus necrosis (expressed as \% of LV circumference). RESULTS: After successful PCI (n = 22, 2 female, mean age: 57 $\pm$ 12y), peak troponin T was 20 $\pm$ 36ug/l and the LV ejection fraction on CMR was 41 $\pm$ 8\%. Necrosis mass was 30 $\pm$ 10\% and CURE was 0.91 $\pm$ 0.05. Edema was measured as 58 $\pm$ 14\% of the LV circumference. In the acute phase, the extent of edema correlated with dyssynchrony (r2 = -0.63, p $\backslash$textless 0.01), while extent of necrosis showed borderline correlation (r2 = -0.19, p = 0.05). PCI resulted in salvaged myocardium of 27 $\pm$ 14\%. LV dyssynchrony (=CURE) decreased at 4 months from 0.91 $\pm$ 0.05 to 0.94 $\pm$ 0.03 (p $\backslash$textless 0.004, paired t-test). At 4 months, edema was absent and scar \%LV slightly shrunk to 23.7 $\pm$ 10.0\% (p $\backslash$textless 0.002 vs baseline). Regression of LV dyssynchrony during the 4 months follow-up period was predicted by both, the extent of edema and its necrosis component in the acute phase. CONCLUSIONS: In the acute phase of infarction, LV dyssynchrony is closely related to the extent of edema, while necrosis is a poor predictor of acute LV dyssynchrony. Conversely, regression of intraventricular LV dyssynchrony during infarct healing is predicted by the extent of necrosis in the acute phase.},

This model considers damage as anisotropic in tension but isotropic in compression, and incorporates asymmetry between tension and compression. In spite of its complexity, it is expressed in a format fit for numerical calculations by the finite element method, and involves only six material parameters (in addition to the usual elastic constants), which makes it suitable for applications to large industrial structures. The material parameters can be identified from simple uniaxial and biaxial experiments. The application envisaged relates to the failure of some cylindrical nuclear containment vessel subjected to some excessive internal pressure. This structure is made of reinforced concrete containing both passive (initially stress-free) steel armatures and pre-stressed cables. The numerical results illustrate the importance of incorporation of both asymmetry between tension and compression and anisotropy of damage in the simulation to accurately predict the resistance of the structure to fracture.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated that cardiomyocyte Ca2+release is desynchronized in several pathological conditions. Loss of Ca2+ release synchrony has been attributed to t-tubule disruption, but it is unknown if other factors also contribute. We investigated this issue in normal and failing myocytes by integrating experimental data with a mathematical model describing spatiotemporal dynamics of Ca2+ in the cytosol and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Heart failure development in postinfarction mice was associated with progressive t-tubule disorganization, as quantified by fast-Fourier transforms. Data from fast-Fourier transforms were then incorporated in the model as a dyadic organization index, reflecting the proportion of ryanodine receptors located in dyads. With decreasing dyadic-organization index, the model predicted greater dyssynchrony of Ca 2+ release, which exceeded that observed in experimental line-scan images. Model and experiment were reconciled by reducing the threshold for Ca2+ release in the model, suggesting that increased RyR sensitivity partially offsets the desynchronizing effects of t-tubule disruption in heart failure. Reducing the magnitude of SR Ca2+ content and release, whether experimentally by thapsigargin treatment, or in the model, desynchronized the Ca2+ transient. However, in cardiomyocytes isolated from SERCA2 knockout mice, RyR sensitization offset such effects. A similar interplay between RyR sensitivity and SR content was observed during treatment of myocytes with low-dose caffeine. Initial synchronization of Ca 2+ release during caffeine was reversed as SR content declined due to enhanced RyR leak. Thus, synchrony of cardiomyocyte Ca2+ release is not only determined by t-tubule organization but also by the interplay between RyR sensitivity and SR Ca2+ content. \textcopyright{} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

In keeping with the traditions of mechanics, the formulation was based on the results of mechanical tests on specimens whose size is measured in centimeters. To model the observations which describe the deterioration of material properties it was found necessary to introduce internal variables referred to as `damage'. The approach is phenomenological, with only a minimal attempt to provide a physical interpretation of damage. For this reason the approach has had little appeal to those whose interest is in the physical mechanisms which cause material deterioration. In this presentation a description is given of attempts to develop continuum damage mechanics so that the relationship with the physical mechanism approach is less abrupt. The procedure is illustrated with reference to ceramic matrix composites.},

However, systolic three-dimensional deformation of the laminae has never been measured. Therefore, end-systolic finite strains relative to end diastole, from biplane radiography of transmural markers near the apex and base of the anesthetized open-chest canine anterior left ventricular free wall (n = 6), were referred to three-dimensional laminar microstructural axes reconstructed from histology. Whereas fiber shortening was uniform [-0.07 +/- 0.04 (SD)], radial wall thickening increased from base (0. 10 +/- 0.09) to apex (0.14 +/- 0.13). Extension of the laminae transverse to the muscle fibers also increased from base (0.08 +/- 0. 07) to apex (0.11 +/- 0.08), and interlaminar shear changed sign [0. 05 +/- 0.07 (base) and -0.07 +/- 0.09 (apex)], reflecting variations in laminar architecture. Nevertheless, the apex and base were similar in that at each site laminar extension and shear contributed approximately 60 and 40\%, respectively, of mean transmural thickening. Kinematic considerations suggest that these dual wall-thickening mechanisms may have distinct ultrastructural origins.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.11.028},
  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The postnatal heart grows mostly in response to increased hemodynamic load. However, the specific biomechanical stimuli that stimulate cardiac growth as a reaction to increased hemodynamic load are still poorly understood. It has been shown that isolated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes normalize resting sarcomere length by adding sarcomeres in series when subjected to uniaxial static strain. Because there is experimental evidence that myocytes can distinguish the direction of stretch, it was postulated that myocytes also may normalize interfilament lattice spacing as a response to cross-fiber stretch. METHODS: A growth law was proposed in which fiber axial growth was stimulated by fiber strain deviating from zero and fiber radial growth by cross-fiber strain (parallel to the wall surface) deviating from zero. Fiber radial growth rate constant was 1/3 of the fiber axial growth rate constant. The growth law was implemented in a finite element model of the newborn Sprague-Dawley rat residually stressed left ventricle (LV). The LV was subjected to an end-diastolic pressure of 1 kPa and about 25 weeks of normal growth was simulated. RESULTS: Most cellular and chamber dimension changes in the model matched experimentally measured ones: LV cavity and wall volume increased from 2.3 and 54 $\mu$l, respectively, in the newborn to 276 $\mu$l and 1.1 ml, respectively, in the adult rat; LV shape became more spherical; internal LV radius increased faster than wall thickness; and unloaded sarcomere lengths exhibited a transmural gradient. The major discrepancy with experiments included a reversed transmural gradient of cell length in the older rat. CONCLUSION: A novel strain-based growth law has been presented that reproduced physiological postnatal growth in the rat LV.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0072795},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Human myocardium has a complex and anisotropic 3D fiber pattern. It remains unknown, however, when in fetal life this anisotropic pattern develops and whether the human heart is structurally fully mature at birth. We aimed here to use diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) tractography to characterize the evolution of fiber architecture in the developing human fetal heart. METHODS: Human fetal hearts (n = 5) between 10-19 weeks of gestation were studied. The heart from a 6-day old neonate and an adult human heart served as controls. The degree of myocardial anisotropy was measured by calculating the fractional anisotropy (FA) index. In addition, fiber tracts were created by numerically integrating the primary eigenvector field in the heart into coherent streamlines. RESULTS: At 10-14 weeks the fetal hearts were highly isotropic and few tracts could be resolved. Between 14-19 weeks the anisotropy seen in the adult heart began to develop. Coherent fiber tracts were well resolved by 19 weeks. The 19-week myocardium, however, remained weakly anisotropic with a low FA and no discernable sheet structure. CONCLUSIONS: The human fetal heart remains highly isotropic until 14-19 weeks, at which time cardiomyocytes self-align into coherent tracts. This process lags 2-3 months behind the onset of cardiac contraction, which may be a prerequisite for cardiomyocyte maturation and alignment. No evidence of a connective tissue scaffold guiding this process could be identified by DTI. Maturation of the heart's sheet structure occurs late in gestation and evolves further after birth.},

  abstract = {A model is proposed for predicting the non-linear stress-strain relations and ultimate failure of microcomposite specimens as a function of interfacial characteristics. The description of the matrix cracking process and fiber failure is based on fracture statistics. The microcomposite specimen consists of a single fiber coated with concentric layers of interfacial material and matrix. It is representative of the constituents in the actual composite and is appropriate for designing interphases. This approach was applied to practical SiC/SiC microcomposites specimens made by Chemical Vapor Deposition. The predictions of matrix cracking compare satisfactorily with experimental data. Important trends in the influence of interfaces upon the stress-strain behavior are thus predicted and discussed in relation to available experimental results.},

The Weibull theory is used to deal with the scaffolds' constitutive rods statistical failure, and the Sanchez-Palencia theory of periodic homogenization is used to link the rod- and scaffold-scales. Uniaxial compression of scaffolds and three-point bending of rods were performed to calibrate and validate the model. If calibration based on rod-scale data leads to over-conservative predictions of scaffold's properties (as rods' successive failures are not taken into account), we show that, for a given rod diameter, calibration based on scaffold-scale data leads to very satisfactory predictions for a wide range of rod spacing, i.e. of scaffold porosity, as well as for different loading conditions. This work establishes the proposed model as a reliable tool for understanding and optimizing cellular ceramics' mechanical properties.},

  abstract = {In the intact heart, the distribution of electromechanical delay (EMD), the time interval between local depolarization and myocyte shortening onset, depends on the loading conditions. The distribution of EMD throughout the heart remains, however, unknown because current experimental techniques are unable to evaluate three-dimensional cardiac electromechanical behavior. The goal of this study was to determine the three-dimensional EMD distributions in the intact ventricles for sinus rhythm (SR) and epicardial pacing (EP) by using a new, to our knowledge, electromechanical model of the rabbit ventricles that incorporates a biophysical representation of myofilament dynamics. Furthermore, we aimed to ascertain the mechanisms that underlie the specific three-dimensional EMD distributions. The results revealed that under both conditions, the three-dimensional EMD distribution is nonuniform. During SR, EMD is longer at the epicardium than at the endocardium, and is greater near the base than at the apex. After EP, the three-dimensional EMD distribution is markedly different; it also changes with the pacing rate. For both SR and EP, late-depolarized regions were characterized with significant myofiber prestretch caused by the contraction of the early-depolarized regions. This prestretch delays myofiber-shortening onset, and results in a longer EMD, giving rise to heterogeneous three-dimensional EMD distributions.},

To overcome the tricky and well-known compromise between spatial resolution and uncertainty, a multiscale approach to FE-DIC is proposed. Additional nearfield images are used to improve locally the resolu- tion of the measurement for a given measurement mesh. An automatic and accurate estimation of the nearfield/farfield transformation is obtained by a dedicated DIC based method, in order to bridge precisely the measurement per- formed at both scales. This multiscale measurement is then associated to a multiscale Finite Element Model Updating (FEMU) identification technique. After being validated on synthetic test cases, the method is applied to a tensile test carried out on an open-hole specimen made of glass/epoxy laminate. The four in-plane orthotropic elastic parameters are identified at different levels of loading. Results show that the multiscale approach greatly improves the uncer- tainty of both the measured displacements and the identified material parameters},

The second step interpolates the associated linear operators on their appropriate matrix manifold. Real-time performance is achieved by precomputing inner products between the reduced-order bases underlying the precomputed ROMs. The proposed method is illustrated by applications in mechanical and aeronautical engineering. In particular, its robustness is demonstrated by its ability to handle the case where the sampled parameter set values exhibit a mode veering phenomenon.},

During exercise, LVEF increased in 475 subjects by +8.0 EF\% (range 3-15\%), a normal increase being accepted to be greater than or equal to 5\% over a normal resting value for both LVEF and RVEF. Subgroup analysis of results at rest revealed no significant differences regarding selection of normal subjects (based on normal catheterization findings vs. normal volunteers with low probability of disease), age or sex. During exercise, however, significantly larger increases in LVEF measurements were noted for men versus women (P less than 0.01), for normal volunteers versus subjects selected as 'normals' based on a normal coronary angiogram (P less than 0.001) and for younger versus older subjects (P less than 0.001). Data on reproducibility and variability showed that radionuclide angiocardiography can be considered to be a reliable method today. No consensus was found for measurements of regional LV function or wall motion mainly because of differences in methodology used. These normal values may serve as general guidelines for future applications of these techniques but factors which may influence the normal range as defined and discussed in this study should be recognized.},

  title = {Design of {{Architectured Sandwich Core Materials Using Topological Optimization Methods}}},
  abstract = {Sandwich structures are especially interesting when multiple functionalities (such as stiffness and thermal insulation) are required. Properties of these structures are strongly dependent on the general geometry of the sandwich, but also on the detailed patterns of matter partitioning within the core. Therefore it seems possible to tailor the core pattern in order to obtain the desired properties. But multi-functional specifications and the infinite number of possible shapes, leads to non-trivial selection and/or optimization problems. In this context of "material by design", we propose a numerical approach, based on structural optimization techniques, to find the core pattern that leads to the best performances for a given set of conflicting specifications. The distribution of matter is defined thanks to a level-set function, and the convergence toward the optimized pattern is performed through the evolution of this function on a fixed grid. It is shown that the solutions of optimization are strongly dependent on the formulation of the problem, which have to be chosen with respect to the physics. A first application of this approach is presented for the design of sandwich core materials, in order to obtain the best compromise between flexural stiffness and relative density. The influence of both the initialization (starting geometry) and the formulation of the optimization problem are detailed.},

  abstract = {In this study we present a novel, robust method to couple finite element (FE) models of cardiac mechanics to systems models of the circulation (CIRC), independent of cardiac phase. For each time step through a cardiac cycle, left and right ventricular pressures were calculated using ventricular compliances from the FE and CIRC models. These pressures served as boundary conditions in the FE and CIRC models. In succeeding steps, pressures were updated to minimize cavity volume error (FE minus CIRC volume) using Newton iterations. Coupling was achieved when a predefined criterion for the volume error was satisfied. Initial conditions for the multi-scale model were obtained by replacing the FE model with a varying elastance model, which takes into account direct ventricular interactions. Applying the coupling, a novel multi-scale model of the canine cardiovascular system was developed. Global hemodynamics and regional mechanics were calculated for multiple beats in two separate simulations with a left ventricular ischemic region and pulmonary artery constriction, respectively. After the interventions, global hemodynamics changed due to direct and indirect ventricular interactions, in agreement with previously published experimental results. The coupling method allows for simulations of multiple cardiac cycles for normal and pathophysiology, encompassing levels from cell to system.},

  title = {The {{BOBYQA}} Algorithm for Bound Constrained Optimization without Derivatives},
  abstract = {BOBYQA is an iterative algorithm for finding a minimum of a function F(x), x$\in$Rn, subject to bounds a$\leq$x$\leq$b on the variables, F being specified by a ``black box'' that returns the value F(x) for any feasible x. Each iteration employs a quadratic approximation Q to F that satisfies Q(yj) = F(yj), j = 1, 2, . . . ,m, the interpolation points yj being chosen and adjusted automatically, but m is a prescribed constant, the value m=2n+1 being typical. These conditions leave much freedom in Q, taken up when the model is updated by the highly successful technique of minimizing the Frobenius norm of the change to the second derivative matrix of Q. Thus no first derivatives of F are required explicitly. Most changes to the variables are an approximate solution to a trust region subproblem, using the current quadratic model, with a lower bound on the trust region radius that is reduced cautiously, in order to keep the interpolation points well separated until late in the calculation, which lessens damage from computer rounding errors. Some other changes to the variables are designed to improve the model without reducing F. These techniques are described. Other topics include the starting procedure that is given an initial vector of variables, the value of m and the initial trust region radius. There is also a new device called RESCUE that tries to restore normality if severe loss of accuracy occurs in the matrix calculations of the updating of the model. Numerical results are reported and discussed for two test problems, the numbers of variables being between 10 and 320.},

  abstract = {Ventricular wall stress is believed to be responsible for many physical mechanisms taking place in the human heart, including ventricular remodeling, which is frequently associated with heart failure. Therefore, normalization of ventricular wall stress is the cornerstone of many existing and new treatments for heart failure. In this paper, we sought to construct reference maps of normal ventricular wall stress in humans that could be used as a target for in silico optimization studies of existing and potential new treatments for heart failure. To do so, we constructed personalized computational models of the left ventricles of five normal human subjects using magnetic resonance images and the finite-element method. These models were calibrated using left ventricular volume data extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and validated through comparison with strain measurements from tagged MRI (950 $\pm$ 170 strain comparisons/subject). The calibrated passive material parameter values were C0 = 0.115 $\pm$ 0.008 kPa and B0 = 14.4 $\pm$ 3.18; the active material parameter value was Tmax = 143 $\pm$ 11.1 kPa. These values could serve as a reference for future construction of normal human left ventricular computational models. The differences between the predicted and the measured circumferential and longitudinal strains in each subject were 3.4 $\pm$ 6.3 and 0.5 $\pm$ 5.9\%, respectively. The predicted end-diastolic and end-systolic myofiber stress fields for the five subjects were 2.21 $\pm$ 0.58 and 16.54 $\pm$ 4.73 kPa, respectively. Thus these stresses could serve as targets for in silico design of heart failure treatments.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to validate a deformable image registration technique, termed Hyperelastic Warping, for left ventricular strain measurement during systole using cine-gated, non-tagged MR images with strains measured from tagged MRI. The technique combines deformation from high resolution, non-tagged MR image data with a detailed computational model, including estimated myocardial material properties, fiber direction, and active fiber contraction, to provide a comprehensive description of myocardial contractile function. A normal volunteer (male, age 30) with no history of cardiac pathology was imaged with a 1.5 T Siemens Avanto clinical scanner using a TrueFISP imaging sequence and a 32-channel cardiac coil. Both tagged and non-tagged cine MR images were obtained. The Hyperelastic Warping solution was evolved using a series of non-tagged images in ten intermediate phases from end-diastole to end-systole. The solution may be considered as ten separate warping problems with multiple templates and targets. At each stage, an active contraction was initially applied to a finite element model, and then image-based warping penalty forces were utilized to generate the final registration. Warping results for circumferential strain (R(2)=0.75) and radial strain (R(2)=0.78) were strongly correlated with results obtained from tagged MR images analyzed with a Harmonic Phase (HARP) algorithm. Results for fiber stretch, LV twist, and transmural strain distributions were in good agreement with experimental values in the literature. In conclusion, Hyperelastic Warping provides a unique alternative for quantifying regional LV deformation during systole without the need for tags.},

The introduction of the strong discontinuity kinematics automatically projects any standard dissipative constitutive model, equipped with strain softening, into a discrete traction-separation law that is fulfilled at the discontinuity interface. Numerical issues like a global discontinuity tracking algorithm via a heat conduction-like problem are also presented.

  abstract = {A general theory for the inelasticity of concrete is proposed, the main constituents being a new, rate independent model of distributed damage for mortar and the application of mixture theories to account for the composite nature of concrete. The proposed theory of damage is capable of accommodating fully anisotropic elastic degradation, both in tension and in compression, in a manner which is ideally suited for computation. Mixture theories, on the other hand, are found to provide a simple yet effective tool for characterizing the values of the phase stresses that act on mortar and aggregate and which drive damage and plastic flow. This uneven distribution of stresses between mortar and aggregate is seen to lie at the foundation of effects such as the characteristic splitting failure modes in uniaxial compression and the unloading hysteretic loops that arise during cyclic loading. Further to furnishing useful insights into the physical mechanisms underlying the inelastic behavior of concrete, the proposed model provides a simple means of quantifying such behavior in a way which can be readily implemented in any standard finite element code. Possible generalizations of the theory are suggested. In particular, it is noted how rate and rheological effects can be incorporated into the proposed framework by extending it into the viscoplastic range and through the use of Eyring's theory of thermal activation.},

  doi = {10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.543678},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, one third of patients treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) do not respond. Nonresponse to CRT may be explained by the presence of scar tissue in the posterolateral left ventricular (LV) segments, which may result in ineffective LV pacing and inadequate LV resynchronization. In the present study, the relationship between transmural posterolateral scar tissue and response to CRT was evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty consecutive patients with end-stage heart failure (NYHA class III/IV), LV ejection fraction $\backslash$textless or =35\%, QRS duration $\backslash$textgreater120 ms, left bundle-branch block, and chronic coronary artery disease were included. The localization and transmurality of scar tissue were evaluated with contrast-enhanced MRI. Next, LV dyssynchrony was assessed at baseline and immediately after implantation with tissue Doppler imaging. Clinical parameters, LV volumes, and LV ejection fraction were assessed at baseline and at a 6-month follow-up. Fourteen patients (35\%) had a transmural ($\backslash$textgreater50\% of LV wall thickness) posterolateral scar. In contrast to patients without posterolateral scar tissue, these patients showed a low response rate (14\% versus 81\%; P$\backslash$textless0.05) and did not show improvement in clinical or echocardiographic parameters. In addition, LV dyssynchrony remained unchanged after CRT implantation (84+/-46 versus 78+/-41 ms; P=NS). Patients without posterolateral scar tissue and severe baseline dyssynchrony ($\backslash$textgreater or =65 ms) showed an excellent response rate of 95\% compared with patients with a posterolateral scar and/or absent LV dyssynchrony (11\%). CONCLUSIONS: CRT does not reduce LV dyssynchrony in patients with transmural scar tissue in the posterolateral LV segments, resulting in clinical and echocardiographic nonresponse to CRT.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To examine myocardial deformation and rotation in patients with heart failure, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms that account for normal ejection fraction (EF) in patients with diastolic heart failure (DHF). METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty consecutive patients presenting with congestive heart failure (age: 58 +/- 16 years) underwent simultaneous right heart catheterization and transthoracic echocardiography. Left ventricular (LV) volumes, mass, EF, meridional, and circumferential wall stress were measured in addition to haemodynamic measurements. 2-D speckle tracking was applied to measure longitudinal, radial, and circumferential strain and twist. Twist was reduced only in patients with systolic heart failure (SHF: 5 +/- 2 degrees, DHF: 13 +/- 6 degrees, control: 14 +/- 5 degrees, P $\backslash$textless 0.001). Circumferential strain was not different between DHF (-15 +/- 5\%) and control groups (-20 +/- 3\%, P $\backslash$textgreater 0.05), though it was significantly lower in patients with SHF (-7 +/- 3\%, P $\backslash$textless 0.05). Importantly, longitudinal (DHF:-12\%, SHF: -4\%, control: -19\%, P $\backslash$textless 0.001) and radial (DHF: 28 +/- 9\%, SHF: 14 +/- 8\%, control: 47 +/- 7\%, P $\backslash$textless 0.001) strains were significantly lower in both heart failure groups than in controls, and were depressed to a larger extent in SHF patients than in those with DHF (both P $\backslash$textless 0.05). CONCLUSION: LV longitudinal and radial strains are reduced, but circumferential deformation and twist are normal in DHF patients. On the other hand, in patients with SHF, longitudinal, radial, and circumferential deformation, and twist are all reduced. Multivariable regression analysis suggests that preserved LV twist and circumferential strain may contribute to normal EF in patients with DHF.},

  abstract = {In vivo imaging of the cardiac 3D fibre architecture is still a challenge, but it would have many clinical applications, for instance to better understand pathologies and to follow up remodelling after therapy. Recently, cardiac MRI enabled the acquisition of Diffusion Tensor images (DTI) of 2D slices. We propose a method for the complete 3D reconstruction of cardiac fibre architecture in the left ventricular myocardium from sparse in vivo DTI slices. This is achieved in two steps. First we map non-linearly the left ventricular geometry to a truncated ellipsoid. Second, we express coordinates and tensor components in Prolate Spheroidal System, where an anisotropic Gaussian kernel regression interpolation is performed. The framework is initially applied to a statistical cardiac DTI atlas in order to estimate the optimal anisotropic bandwidths. Then, it is applied to in vivo beating heart DTI data sparsely acquired on a healthy subject. Resulting in vivo tensor field shows good correlation with literature, especially the elevation (helix) angle transmural variation. To our knowledge, this is the first reconstruction of in vivo human 3D cardiac fibre structure. Such approach opens up possibilities in terms of analysis of the fibre architecture in patients.},

  abstract = {The development of materials to support bone regeneration requires flexible fabrication technologies able to tailor chemistry and architecture for specific applications. In this work we describe the preparation of ceramic-based inks for robotic-assisted deposition (robocasting) using Pluronic F-127 solutions. This approach allows the preparation of pseudoplastic inks with solid contents ranging between 30 and 50 vol.\%, enabling them to flow through a narrow printing nozzle while supporting the weight of the printed structure. Ink formulation does not require manipulation of the pH or the use of highly volatile organic components. Therefore, the approach can be used to prepare materials with a wide range of compositions, and here we use it to build hydroxyapatite (HA), beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) and biphasic (HA/beta-TCP) structures. The flow of the inks is controlled by the Pluronic content and the particle size distribution of the ceramic powders. The use of wide size distributions favors flow through the narrow printing nozzles and we have been able to use printing nozzles as narrow as 100 microm in diameter, applying relatively low printing pressures. The microporosity of the printed lines increases with increasing Pluronic content and lower sintering temperatures. Microporosity can play a key role in determining the biological response to the materials, but it also affects the strength of the structure.},

  doi = {10.1016/S0003-4975(03)00731-8},
  abstract = {Background. The Myocor Myosplint is a transcavitary tensioning device designed to change left ventricular (LV) shape and reduce wall stress. Regional wall stress cannot be measured in the intact heart and LV function after surgical remodeling is often confounded by inotropic agents and mitral repair. We used a realistic mathematical (finite element) model of the dilated human LV to test the hypothesis that Myosplint decreased regional ventricular fiber stress and improved LV function. Methods. A finite element model was used to simulate the effects of Myosplint on the LV stroke volume/end-diastolic pressure (Starling) relationship and regional distributions of stress in the local muscle fiber direction (fiber stress) for a wide range of diastolic and end-systolic material properties. The nonlinear stress-strain relationship for the diastolic myocardium was anisotropic with respect to the local muscle fiber direction. An elastance model for active fiber stress was incorporated in an axisymmetric geometric model of the globally dilated LV wall. Results. Both diastolic compliance and end-systolic elastance shifted to the left on the pressure-volume diagram. LV end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volumes were reduced by 7.6\% and 8.6\%, respectively. Mean end-diastolic and end-systolic fiber stress was decreased by 24\% and 16\%, respectively. Although the effect of Myosplint on the Starling relationship was not significant, there were trends toward an improvement in this relationship at low diastolic stiffness, C, high peak intracellular calcium concentration, Ca0, and high arterial elastance, EA. Of note, the effect of C was twice that of Ca 0 and EA. Diastolic function would, therefore, be expected to be the prime determinant of success with Myosplint. Conclusions. Myosplint reduces fiber stress without a decrement in the Starling relationship. Myosplint should be much more effective than partial ventriculectomy as a surgical therapy for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and end-stage congestive heart failure. \textcopyright{} 2003 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.},

This can be thought of as a version of the traveling salesman problem, in which an underlying known metric determines the cost of moving through each point of the domain, but in which the actual shortest path between cities is unknown at the outset. We describe algorithms for both a heuristic and an optimal solution to this problem. The complexity of the heuristic algorithm is at worst case M.N log N, where M is the number of cities, and N the size of the computational mesh used to approximate the solutions to the shortest paths problems. The average runtime of the heuristic algorithm is linear in the number of cities and O(N log N) in the size N of the mesh.},

  abstract = {In Part I of this paper, we presented a general homogenization framework for determining the overall behavior, the evolution of the underlying microstructure, and the possible onset of macroscopic instabilities in fiber-reinforced elastomers subjected to finite deformations. In this work, we make use of this framework to generate specific results for general plane-strain loading of elastomers reinforced with aligned, cylindrical fibers. For the special case of rigid fibers and incompressible behavior for the matrix phase, closed-form, analytical results are obtained. The results suggest that the evolution of the microstructure has a dramatic effect on the effective response of the composite. Furthermore, in spite of the fact that both the matrix and the fibers are assumed to be strongly elliptic, the homogenized behavior is found to lose strong ellipticity at sufficiently large deformations, corresponding to the possible development of macroscopic instabilities [Geymonat, G., M{\"u}ller, S., Triantafyllidis, N., 1993. Homogenization of nonlinearly elastic materials, macroscopic bifurcation and macroscopic loss of rank-one convexity. Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal. 122, 231\textendash{}290]. The connection between the evolution of the microstructure and these macroscopic instabilities is put into evidence. In particular, when the reinforced elastomers are loaded in compression along the long, in-plane axis of the fibers, a certain type of ``flopping'' instability is detected, corresponding to the composite becoming infinitesimally soft to rotation of the fibers.},

Traditionally, skeletal biomechanics has focussed on how these tissues perform the structural and locomotory functions of the vertebrate skeleton. In mechanobiology the central question is how these same load-bearing tissues are produced, maintained and adapted by cells as an active response to biophysical stimuli in their environment. The idea that 'form follows function' is not new, but we now believe that the scientific community has the knowledge and tools to prove, understand and use functional adaptation to benefit medicine and human health. In this Survey Article the philosophy and progress of skeletal mechanobiology are discussed. The revival of this science, with roots dating back to the 19th Century, is now driven by new developments in cellular, molecular and computational technologies. These developments are still in an early stage of application, but if modern mechanobiology fulfills the promises of its ambitions, the results will bring great benefits to tissue engineering and to the treatment and prevention of skeletal conditions such as congenital deformities, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and bone fractures.},

  abstract = {Microstructure-based constitutive models have been adopted in recent studies of non-linear mechanical properties of biological soft tissues. These models provide more accurate predictions of the overall mechanical responses of tissues than phenomenological approaches. Based on standard approximations in non-linear mechanics, we classified the microstructural models into three categories: (1) uniform-field models with solid-like matrix, (2) uniform-field models with fluid-like matrix, and (3) second-order estimate models. The first two categories assume affine deformation field where the deformation of microstructure is the same as that of the tissue, regardless of material heterogeneities; i.e., they represent the upper bounds of the exact effective strain energy and stress of soft tissues. In addition, the first type is not purely structurally motivated and hence cannot accurately predict the microscopic mechanical behaviors of soft tissues. The third category considers realistic geometrical features, material properties of microstructure and interactions among them and allows for flexible deformation in each constituent. The uniform-field model with fluid-like matrix and the second-order estimate model are microstructure-based, and can be applied to different tissues based on micro-structural features. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {A new modeling approach to subcritical crack propagation (i.e. static fatigue) in ceramics is introduced and applied to the case of ceramic fibers. This approach relies on classical fracture mechanics, in which the zone near the crack's tip is modified by the environment (particularly through oxidation). Chemical reactions and diffusion are introduced naturally, which makes the model highly dependent on the environmental conditions, such as partial oxygen pressure. In some cases, the result comes down to the widely-used Paris-like subcritical crack propagation law. For the general case, a two-parameter model calibrated and validated up to 1000$^\circ$C for Hi-Nicalon fibers is presented. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

They are therefore becoming increasingly important as model systems to study processes of interest in condensed-matter physics such as melting, freezing and glass transitions. The solidification of colloidal suspensions has long been a puzzling phenomenon with many unexplained features. Here, we demonstrate and rationalize the existence of instability and metastability domains in cellular solidification of colloidal suspensions, by direct in situ high-resolution X-ray radiography and tomography observations. We explain such interface instabilities by a partial Brownian diffusion of the particles leading to constitutional supercooling situations. Processing under unstable conditions leads to localized and global kinetic instabilities of the solid/liquid interface, affecting the crystal morphology and particle redistribution behaviour.},

The governing differential equations for the fiber displacements and stresses are solved exactly for any configuration of breaks using an influence superposition technique. The model predicts the tensile strength of well bonded, elastic fiber/matrix systems with fibers arranged in a square array. Length and strength scalings are used which are relevant for elastic, local load sharing composites. Several hundred Monte Carlo simulations were executed to determine the statistical strength distributions of the composite for three values of the fiber Weibull modulus, m = 5, 10 and 20. Stress-strain behavior and the evolution of fiber damage are studied. Bundle sizes of 10 x 10, 15 x 15, 20 x 20, 25 x 25, 30 x 30 and 35 x 35 fibers of various lengths are investigated to determine the dependence of strength on the composite size.

  abstract = {The majority of patients with clinically diagnosed heart failure have normal systolic pump function and are commonly categorized as suffering from diastolic heart failure. The left ventricle (LV) remodels its structure and function to adapt to pathophysiological changes in geometry and loading conditions, which in turn can alter the passive ventricular mechanics. In order to better understand passive ventricular mechanics, a LV finite element (FE) model was customized to geometric data segmented from in vivo tagged magnetic resonance images (MRI) data and myofibre orientation derived from ex vivo diffusion tensor MRI (DTMRI) of a canine heart using nonlinear finite element fitting techniques. MRI tissue tagging enables quantitative evaluation of cardiac mechanical function with high spatial and temporal resolution, whilst the direction of maximum water diffusion in each voxel of a DTMRI directly corresponds to the local myocardial fibre orientation. Due to differences in myocardial geometry between in vivo and ex vivo imaging, myofibre orientations were mapped into the geometric FE model using host mesh fitting (a free form deformation technique). Pressure recordings, temporally synchronized to the tagging data, were used as the loading constraints to simulate the LV deformation during diastole. Simulation of diastolic LV mechanics allowed us to estimate the stiffness of the passive LV myocardium based on kinematic data obtained from tagged MRI. Integrated physiological modelling of this kind will allow more insight into mechanics of the LV on an individualized basis, thereby improving our understanding of the underlying structural basis of mechanical dysfunction under pathological conditions.},

  abstract = {An approach to efficiently measure three-dimensional velocity vector fields and turbulent kinetic energy of blood flow is presented. Multipoint phase-contrast imaging is used in combination with Bayesian analysis to map both mean and fluctuating velocities over a large dynamic range and for practically relevant signal-to-noise ratios. It is demonstrated that the approach permits significant spatiotemporal undersampling to allow for clinically acceptable scan times. Using numerical simulations and in vitro measurements in aortic valve phantoms, it is shown that for given scan time, Bayesian multipoint velocity encoding provides consistently lower errors of velocity and turbulent kinetic energy over a larger dynamic range relative to previous methods. In vitro, significant differences in both peak velocity and turbulent kinetic energy between the aortic CoreValve (150 cm/s, 293 J/m(3) ) and the St. Jude Medical mechanical valve (120 cm/s, 149 J/m(3) ) were found. Comparison of peak turbulent kinetic energy measured in a patient with aortic stenosis (950 J/m(3) ) and in a patient with an implanted aortic CoreValve (540 J/m(3) ) revealed considerable differences relative to the values detected in healthy subjects (149 +/- 12 J/m(3) ) indicating the potential of the method to provide a comprehensive hemodynamic assessment of valve performance in vivo.

  abstract = {A formulation for anisotropic damage is established in the framework of the principle of strain equivalence. The damage variable is still related to the surface density of microcracks and microvoids and, as its evolution is governed by the plastic strain, it is represented by a second order tensor and is orthotropic. The coupling of damage with elasticity is written through a tensor on the deviatoric part of the energy and through a scalar taken as its trace on the hydrostatic part. The kinetic law of damage evolution is an extension of the isotropic case. Here, the principal components of the damage rate tensor are proportional to the absolute value of principal components of the plastic strain rate tensor and are a nonlinear function of the effective elastic strain energy. The proposed damage evolution law does not introduce any other material parameter. Several series of experiments on metals give a good validation of this theory. The coupling of damage with plasticity and the quasi-unilateral conditions of partial closure of microcracks naturally derive from the concept of effective stress. Finally, a study of strain localization makes it possible to determine the critical value of the damage at mesocrack initiation.},

The local shear damage and inelastic strain evolution laws and the non-local fibre rupture criterion have been integrated in Abaqus.

Microscopic mechanical properties of SiC were calibrated by comparing the numerical tests in PFC2D with the equivalent experimental results, and introduced into the subsequent modeling of the ceramic machining process. The dynamic process of initiation and propagation of the micro-cracks under various machining conditions has been explicitly modeled in the DEM simulations. The numerical results from DEM modeling agreed well with the experimental observations and theoretical predictions. Rational relations between cracking damage of ceramics and cutting conditions have been established based on the analysis of simulation results. A generalized model of defining the range of inelastic zone has also been developed based on the numerical results.

  volume = {42},
  issn = {0956-7151},
  abstract = {Observations of failure mechanisms in monotonic loading are reported for graphite/epoxy composites containing three-dimensional (3D) interlock weave reinforcement. The key phenomena are delamination and kink band formation in compression, tow rupture and pullout in tension, and combinations of these in bending. The materials exhibit great potential for damage tolerance and notch insensitivity. This is partly due to the presence of geometrical flaws that are broadly distributed in strength and space; and partly to the coarseness of the reinforcing tows, which leads to extensive debonding and reduced stress intensification around sites of failure. Rules of mixture corrected for the effects of tow irregularity suffice to estimate elastic moduli. Rough estimates of the stress at which the first failure events occur in compression or tension can be made from existing micromechanical models. Ultimate tensile failure might be modeled by regarding failed tows that are being pulled out of the composite as a cohesive zone. The characteristic length estimated for this zone, which is a direct measure of damage tolerance and notch insensitivity, has very large values of order of magnitude 0.1-0.5 m.},

  abstract = {Motion of the heart has complicated in vivo applications of cardiac diffusion MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), especially in small animals such as rats where ultra-high-performance gradient sets are currently not available. Even with velocity compensation via, for example, bipolar encoding pulses, the variable shot-to-shot residual motioninduced spin phase can still give rise to pronounced artifacts. This study presents diffusion-encoding schemes that are designed to compensate for higher-order motion components, including acceleration and jerk, which also have the desirable practical features of minimal TEs and high achievable b-values. The effectiveness of these schemes was verified numerically on a realistic beating heart phantom, and demonstrated empirically with in vivo cardiac diffusion MRI in rats. Compensation for acceleration, and lower motion components, was found to be both necessary and sufficient for obtaining diffusion-weighted images of acceptable quality and SNR, which yielded the first in vivo cardiac DTI demonstrated in the rat. These findings suggest that compensation for higher order motion, particularly acceleration, can be an effective alternative solution to high-performance gradient hardware for improving in vivo cardiac DTI.},

  title = {Regional Differences in Myocyte Size in Normal Rat Heart},
  volume = {215},
  abstract = {Three independent methods were evaluated in an effort to obtain reliable values for myocyte size in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Cell volume was determined from isolated myocytes by a Coulter Channelyzer system. Cell volume was also determined from the product of length and cross-sectional area of isolated myocytes. Additionally, myocyte cross-sectional area was measured morphometrically from electron micrographs of whole perfusion-fixed tissue. A major goal was to determine if anatomical methods used to measure cell volume produce values comparable to the more expeditious and objective Coulter Channelyzer method. The results of these experiments showed that myocyte dimensions obtained from all three techniques were similar. The second major objective was to use the above-mentioned techniques to evaluate regional differences in myocyte size. Myocyte cross-sectional area and volume were significantly larger in the endomyocardium than in the epimyocardium of the left ventricle. Right ventricle myocytes had significantly smaller volumes and cross-sectional areas than did left ventricle myocytes. There were no regional differences in cell lengths. We conclude that the Coulter Channelyzer system gives values for isolated myocyte volume that are similar to values obtained with histometric techniques; values for isolated myocyte cross-sectional area were representative of values obtained from myocytes in whole-sectioned tissue; significant regional differences in myocyte size are present in adult rat hearts; and regional variations in myocyte size are due to differences in myocyte cross-sectional area rather than cell length.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative analysis of segmental myocardial deformation of different myocardial layers has become possible using strain-encoded cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (SENC) and speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE). We evaluated and compared the quantitative analysis of myocardial deformation using SENC and STE. METHODS: In 44 patients (age 61 $\pm$ 13 years, 34 men), SENC by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging using a 1.5-Tesla whole-body scanner and two-dimensional STE were performed prospectively. Quantitative layer-specific analysis of segmental left ventricular function was performed to determine the peak circumferential and peak longitudinal systolic strain values using SENC and STE of an endocardial and epicardial myocardial layer. In addition, segmental function was defined as normokinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic by visual analysis of the magnetic resonance imaging cine sequences. RESULTS: The endocardial and epicardial strain defined by SENC or STE differed significantly between the visually defined segmental function states. The correlation of the peak circumferential endocardial strain by SENC versus STE (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 0.493, 95\% CI 0.358-0.597) tended to be better than the correlation of the circumferential epicardial strain using both methods (ICC 0.321, 95\% CI 0.238-0.399). The correlation of the peak longitudinal endocardial strain by SENC and STE was similar (ICC 0.472, 95\% CI 0.398-0.541), in contrast to the longitudinal epicardial strain analysis by both techniques (ICC 0.554, 95\% CI 0.417-0.655). Circumferential strain analysis by STE allowed better distinction of the hypokinetic or akinetic segments from the normokinetic segments than did the circumferential strain analysis by SENC of the endocardial layer (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC ROC] 0.946 vs 0.884; P $\backslash$textless .001) or epicardial layer (AUC ROC 0.884 vs 0.782; P $\backslash$textless .001). Longitudinal strain analysis using STE and SENC of the endocardial layer (AUC ROC 0.851 vs 0.839; P = .5838) and epicardial layer (AUC ROC 0.849 vs 0.833; P = .4321) had similar diagnostic value for identifying the presence of hypokinetic and akinetic segments. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative analysis of segmental deformation by SENC and STE allowed accurate distinction of myocardial segments with different functional states. Circumferential endocardial strain analysis by STE allowed the best distinction of segments with impaired function from the normokinetic segments.},

  abstract = {The heart has the ability to respond to long-term changes in its environment through changes in mass (growth), shape (morphogenesis) and tissue properties (remodeling). For improved quantitative understanding of cardiac growth and remodeling (G\&R) experimental studies need to be complemented by mathematical models. This paper reviews models for cardiac growth and remodeling of myofiber orientation, as induced by mechanical stimuli. A distinction is made between optimization models, that focus on the end stage of G\&R, and adaptation models, that aim to more closely describe the mechanistic relation between stimulus and effect. While many models demonstrate qualitatively promising results, a lot of questions remain, e.g. with respect to the choice of the stimulus for G\&R or the long-term stability of the outcome of the model. A continued effort combining information on mechanotransduction at the cellular level, experimental observations on G\&R at organ level, and testing of hypotheses on stimulus-effect relations in mathematical models is needed to answer these questions on cardiac G\&R. Ultimately, models of cardiac G\&R seem indispensable for patient-specific modeling, both to reconstruct the actual state of the heart and to assess the long-term effect of potential interventions.},

  abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to establish a new, dynamic 3-dimensional cardiac magnetic resonance (3D-CMR) perfusion scan technique exploiting data correlation in k-space and time with sensitivity-encoding and to determine its value for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) and volumetry of myocardial hypoenhancement (VOLUMEhypo) before and after percutaneous coronary stenting. Background Dynamic 3D-CMR perfusion imaging might improve detection of myocardial perfusion deficits and could facilitate direct volumetry of myocardial hypoenhancement. Methods In 146 patients with known or suspected CAD, a 3.0-T CMR examination was performed including cine imaging, 3D-CMR perfusion under adenosine stress and at rest followed by delayed enhancement imaging. Quantitative invasive coronary angiography defined significant CAD ($\backslash$textless50\% luminal narrowing). Forty-eight patients underwent an identical repeat CMR examination after percutaneous stenting of at least 1 coronary lesion. The 3D-CMR perfusion scans were visually classified as pathologic if $\backslash$textless1 segment showed an inducible perfusion deficit in the absence of delayed enhancement. The VOLUMEhypo was measured by segmentation of the area of inducible hypoenhancement and normalized to left-ventricular myocardial volume (\%VOLUMEhypo). Results The 3D-CMR perfusion resulted in a sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of 91.7\%, 74.3\%, and 82.9\%, respectively. Before and after coronary stenting, \%VOLUME hypo averaged to 14.2 ?? 9.5\% and 3.2 ?? 5.2\%, respectively, with a relative VOLUMEhypo reduction of 79.4 ?? 25.4\%. Intrareader and inter-reader reproducibility of VOLUMEhypo measurements was high (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, 0.96 and 0.96, respectively). Conclusions The 3D-CMR stress perfusion provided high image quality and high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of significant CAD. The VOLUMEhypo measurements were highly reproducible and allowed for the assessment of the treatment effect achievable by percutaneous coronary stenting. ?? 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

important for many applications such as surgery or cosmetic. Due to the highly
hierarchical structure of the tissue, it is interesting to develop microstructural models which have a better predictability and should reduce the consequences of the sample variability. However, these models include in general a quite large number
of mechanical parameters. Therefore, complex assays are required to achieve a
proper identification of the microstructural models. We investigated here the best
experimental protocol to identify a non-linear, anisotropic, model of skin behavior,
namely the Holzapfel's law, using displacement field and forces measures. This
was done through a sensitivity analysis of the different parameters. We determined
first the optimal assay, which appears to be a biaxial test with an alternated loading:
first a stretch in one direction, then in the perpendicular one, and so on. To further
improve the quality of the assay, we also determined the optimal geometry. Interestingly, slightly asymmetric geometries are more adequate than symmetric ones, while being easier to realize. We tested the identification procedure on a numerical example based on a real geometry and including noises based on experimental
noises in the displacement field and force measures.},

Bioactive glass has appealing characteristics as a scaffold material for bone tissue engineering, but the application of glass scaffolds for the repair of load-bearing bone defects is often limited by their low mechanical strength and fracture toughness. This paper provides an overview of recent developments in the fabrication and mechanical properties of bioactive glass scaffolds. The review reveals the fact that mechanical strength is not a real limiting factor in the use of bioactive glass scaffolds for bone repair, an observation not often recognized by most researchers and clinicians. Scaffolds with compressive strengths comparable to those of trabecular and cortical bones have been produced by a variety of methods. The current limitations of bioactive glass scaffolds include their low fracture toughness (low resistance to fracture) and limited mechanical reliability, which have so far received little attention. Future research directions should include the development of strong and tough bioactive glass scaffolds, and their evaluation in unloaded and load-bearing bone defects in animal models.},

  abstract = {Complexity of the geometry and structure of the heart hampers easy modeling of cardiac mechanics. The modeling can however be simplified considerably when using the hypothesis that in the normal heart myofiber structure and geometry adapt, until load is evenly distributed. A simple and realistic relationship is found between the hemodynamic variables cavity pressure and volume, and myofiber load parameters stress and strain. The most important geometric parameter in the latter relation is the ratio of cavity volume to wall volume, while actual geometry appears practically irrelevant. Applying the found relationship, a realistic maximum is set to left ventricular pressure after chronic pressure load. Pressures exceeding this level are likely to cause decompensation and heart failure. Furthermore, model is presented to simulate left and right ventricular pump function with left\textendash{}right interaction.},

However, with conventional tagging techniques tagging contrast is impaired at later heart phases due to longitudinal relaxation. An improved method, called Complementary SPAtial Modulation of Magnetization (CSPAMM), which separates the component of the magnetization with the tagging information from the relaxed component by subtraction of two measurements with first a positive and then a negative tagging grid, is presented. This technique improves the grid contrast and greatly facilitates the automatic evaluation of the myocardial motion. Thus the motion assessment of the entire heart cycle becomes possible. The improvements are documented by numerical simulations and by experiments on phantoms and on human volunteers.},

We adopt the concept of finite volume growth characterized through the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic part and a growth part. The functional form of its growth tensor is correlated to sarcomerogenesis, the creation and deposition of new sarcomere units. In response to chronic volume-overload, an increased diastolic wall strain leads to the addition of sarcomeres in series, resulting in a relative increase in cardiomyocyte length, associated with eccentric hypertrophy and ventricular dilation. In response to chronic pressure-overload, an increased systolic wall stress leads to the addition of sacromeres in parallel, resulting in a relative increase in myocyte cross sectional area, associated with concentric hypertrophy and ventricular wall thickening. The continuum equations for both forms of maladaptive growth are discretized in space using a nonlinear finite element approach, and discretized in time using the implicit Euler backward scheme. We explore a generic bi-ventricular heart model in response to volume- and pressure-overload to demonstrate how local changes in cellular morphology translate into global alterations in cardiac form and function.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of high-spatial-resolution myocardial perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 3.0 T by using k-space and time (k-t) domain undersampling with sensitivity encoding (SENSE), or k-t SENSE. Data were compared with results of k-t SENSE-accelerated high-spatial-resolution perfusion MR imaging at 1.5 T and standard-resolution acquisition at 3.0 T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was reviewed and approved by the local ethics review board; informed consent was obtained. k-t SENSE perfusion MR imaging was performed at 1.5 and 3.0 T (fivefold k-t SENSE acceleration; spatial resolution, 1.3 x 1.3 x 10 mm). Fourteen volunteers were studied at rest; 37 patients were studied during adenosine-induced stress. In volunteers, comparison was also made with standard-resolution (2.5 x 2.5 x 10 mm) twofold SENSE perfusion MR imaging results at 3.0 T. Image quality, artifact scores, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and contrast enhancement ratios were derived. In patients, diagnostic accuracy of visual analysis to detect stenosis of more than 50\% narrowing in diameter at quantitative coronary angiography was determined by using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: In volunteers, image quality and artifact scores were similar for 3.0- and 1.5-T k-t SENSE perfusion MR imaging, while SNR was higher (11.6 vs 5.6) and contrast enhancement ratio was lower (1.1 vs 1.5, P = .012) at 3.0 T. Compared with standard-resolution perfusion MR imaging, image quality was higher for 3.0-T k-t SENSE (3.6 vs 3.1, P = .04), endocardial dark rim artifacts were reduced (artifact thickness, 1.6 vs 2.4 mm, P $\backslash$textless .001), and contrast enhancement ratios were similar. In patients, areas under the ROC curve for detection of coronary stenosis were 0.89 and 0.80 (P = .21) for 3.0 and 1.5 T, respectively. CONCLUSION: k-t SENSE-accelerated high-spatial-resolution perfusion MR imaging at 3.0 T is feasible, with similar artifacts and diagnostic accuracy as those at 1.5 T. Compared with standard-resolution twofold SENSE perfusion MR imaging, image quality at k-t SENSE MR imaging is improved and artifacts are reduced.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is considerable heterogeneity in the myocardial substrate of patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), in particular in the etiology of heart failure and in the location of conduction block within the heart. This may account for variability in response to CRT. New approaches, including endocardial and multisite left ventricular (LV) stimulation, may improve CRT response. We sought to evaluate these approaches using noncontact mapping to understand the underlying mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten patients (8 men and 2 women; mean [SD] age 63 [12] years; LV ejection fraction 246\%; QRS duration 161 [24] ms) fulfilling conventional CRT criteria underwent an electrophysiological study, with assessment of acute hemodynamic response to conventional CRT as well as LV endocardial and multisite pacing. LV activation pattern was assessed using noncontact mapping. LV endocardial pacing gave a superior acute hemodynamic response compared with conventional CRT (26\% versus 37\% increase in LV dP/dt(max), respectively; P$\backslash$textless0.0005). There was a trend toward further incremental benefit from multisite LV stimulation, although this did not reach statistical significance (P=0.08). The majority (71\%) of patients with nonischemic heart failure etiology or functional block responded to conventional CRT, whereas those with myocardial scar or absence of functional block often required endocardial or multisite pacing to achieve CRT response. CONCLUSIONS: Endocardial or multisite pacing may be required in certain subsets of patients undergoing CRT. Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and those with narrower QRS, in particular, may stand to benefit.},

  abstract = {A method to extract myocardial coronary permeabilities appropriate to parameterise a continuum porous perfusion model using the underlying anatomical vascular network is developed. Canine and porcine whole-heart discrete arterial models were extracted from high-resolution cryomicrotome vessel image stacks. Five parameterisation methods were considered that are primarily distinguished by the level of anatomical data used in the definition of the permeability and pressure-coupling fields. Continuum multi-compartment porous perfusion model pressure results derived using these parameterisation methods were compared quantitatively via a root-mean-square metric to the Poiseuille pressure solved on the discrete arterial vasculature. The use of anatomical detail to parameterise the porous medium significantly improved the continuum pressure results. The majority of this improvement was attributed to the use of anatomically-derived pressure-coupling fields. It was found that the best results were most reliably obtained by using porosity-scaled isotropic permeabilities and anatomically-derived pressure-coupling fields. This paper presents the first continuum perfusion model where all parameters were derived from the underlying anatomical vascular network.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular Solid Mechanics: Cells, Tissues, and Organs is a vital resource for courses on cardiovascular solid mechanics or soft tissue biomechanics. Focusing on the response of the heart and blood vessels to mechanical loads from the perspective of nonlinear solid mechanics, its primary goal is to integrate basic analytical, experimental, and computational methods to offer a more complete understanding of the underlying mechanobiology. While dealing primarily with cardiovascular mechanics, both the fundamental methods and many of the specific results are applicable to many different soft tissues, making this book an excellent general introduction to soft tissue biomechanics overall. Divided into three parts, Cardiovascular Solid Mechanics presents a practical and rational approach to biomechanics. Part I, Foundations, briefly reviews historical points of interest, basic molecular and cell biology, histology, and an overview of soft tissue mechanics. In order to provide not only a working framework, but also to give key references for those who wish to develop and extend biomechanics, included are mathematical preliminaries and salient results from continuum mechanics, finite elasticity, experimental mechanics, and finite elements. Part II, Vascular Mechanics, reviews the anatomy, histology, and physiology of arteries, illustrating and discussing constitutive formulations and stress analyses for healthy mature arteries. Considerable attention is given to the concept of residual stress and the mechanics of a number of vascular disorders, including atherosclerosis, aneurysms, and hypertension, as well as the mechanics of popular endovascular therapies such as balloon angioplasty. Part III, Cardiac Mechanics, reviews the requisite anatomy, histology, physiology, and pathology, and discusses the constitutive relations and stress analyses in the normal, mature heart. Finally, the book points the reader to areas of study that require more advanced theoretical, experimental, and computational methods, such as electromechanics, thermomechanics, mixture theory analysis of solid-fluid coupling, and damage mechanics. This book is designed as a text for an upper-division course on cardiovascular solid mechanics but will also serve as a good introduction to soft tissue biomechanics. Exercises at the end of each chapter will clarify complex concepts for both students and more experienced readers. Clinicians, life scientists, engineers, and mathematicians will also find this an invaluable guide, with concise and practical chapters, all of which are amply referenced.

  abstract = {The morphogenetic process of cardiac looping transforms the straight heart tube into a curved tube that resembles the shape of the future four-chambered heart. Although great progress has been made in identifying the molecular and genetic factors involved in looping, the physical mechanisms that drive this process have remained poorly understood. Recent work, however, has shed new light on this complicated problem. After briefly reviewing the current state of knowledge, we propose a relatively comprehensive hypothesis for the mechanics of the first phase of looping, termed c-looping, as the straight heart tube deforms into a c-shaped tube. According to this hypothesis, differential hypertrophic growth in the myocardium supplies the main forces that cause the heart tube to bend ventrally, while regional growth and contraction in the omphalomesenteric veins (primitive atria) and compressive loads exerted by the splanchnopleuric membrane drive rightward torsion. A computational model based on realistic embryonic heart geometry is used to test this hypothesis. The behavior of the model is in reasonable agreement with available experimental data from control and perturbed embryos, offering support for our hypothesis. The results also suggest, however, that several other mechanisms contribute secondarily to normal looping, and we speculate that these mechanisms play backup roles when looping is perturbed. Finally, some outstanding questions are discussed for future study.},

  abstract = {The strong coupling between the flow in coronary vessels and the mechanical deformation of the myocardial tissue is a central feature of cardiac physiology and must therefore be accounted for by models of coronary perfusion. Currently available geometrically explicit vascular models fail to capture this interaction satisfactorily, are numerically intractable for whole organ simulations, and are difficult to parameterise in human contexts. To address these issues, in this study, a finite element formulation of an incompressible, poroelastic model of myocardial perfusion is presented. Using high-resolution ex vivo imaging data of the coronary tree, the permeability tensors of the porous medium were mapped onto a mesh of the corresponding left ventricular geometry. The resultant tensor field characterises not only the distinct perfusion regions that are observed in experimental data, but also the wide range of vascular length scales present in the coronary tree, through a multi-compartment porous model. Finite deformation mechanics are solved using a macroscopic constitutive law that defines the coupling between the fluid and solid phases of the porous medium. Results are presented for the perfusion of the left ventricle under passive inflation that show wall-stiffening associated with perfusion, and that show the significance of a non-hierarchical multi-compartment model within a particular perfusion territory.},

  abstract = {A concept of multilayer functional ceramic matrix has been developed to improve the oxidation resistance of carbon fiber based composites. This concept combines (i) a better control of the crack propagation through the brittle matrix by spreading a fuse material in the matrix and (ii) the use of several sealants to improve the efficiency of the sealing process in a large temperature range. The functional matrix is made of the repetition of a unit sequence (BxC1-x / B4C / BxC1-x / SiC). Processing, mechanical behaviour and oxidation resistance of the carbon fiber-reinforced multilayer ceramic matrix composites are discussed. Lifetime tests at high temperature in air are presented and results are compared to those obtained with conventional CMCs. The benefits of the multilayer matrix are extremely significant. The oxidation of carbon fibers based CMCs is reduced whereas the lifetime is strongly improved.},

  abstract = {Injection of biomaterials into diseased myocardium has been associated with decreased myofiber stress, restored left ventricular (LV) geometry and improved LV function. However, its exact mechanism(s) of action remained unclear. In this work, we present the first patient-specific computational model of biomaterial injection that accounts for the possibility of residual strain and stress introduced by this treatment. We show that the presence of residual stress can create more heterogeneous regional myofiber stress and strain fields. Our simulation results show that the treatment generates low stress and stretch areas between injection sites, and high stress and stretch areas between the injections and both the endocardium and epicardium. Globally, these local changes are translated into an increase in average myofiber stress and its standard deviation (from 6.9$\pm$4.6 to 11.2$\pm$48.8kPa and 30$\pm$15 to 35.1$\pm$50.9kPa at end-diastole and end-systole, respectively). We also show that the myofiber stress field is sensitive to the void-to-size ratio. For a constant void size, the myofiber stress field became less heterogeneous with decreasing injection volume. These results suggest that the residual stress and strain possibly generated by biomaterial injection treatment can have large effects on the regional myocardial stress and strain fields, which may be important in the remodeling process.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Separate analysis of endocardial and epicardial myocardial layer deformation has become possible using strain-encoded cardiovascular magnetic resonance (SENC) and 2D-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (Echo). This study evaluated and compared both modalities for the assessment of infarct transmurality as defined by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). METHODS AND RESULTS: In 29 patients (age 62.4 $\pm$ 11.7 years, 23 male) with ischaemic cardiomyopathy, SENC using 1.5 T CMR and Echo were performed. Peak circumferential systolic strain of the endocardial and the epicardial layer of 304 myocardial segments was assessed by SENC and by Echo. The segmental transmurality of myocardial infarction was determined as relative amount of LGE (0\%: no infarction; 1-50\%: non-transmural infarction; 51-100\%: transmural infarction). Endocardial and epicardial strain defined by SENC and by Echo differed significantly between segments of different infarct transmurality determined by CMR. Endocardial layer circumferential strain analysis by Echo and by SENC allowed distinction of segments with non-transmural infarction from non-infarcted segments with similar accuracy [area under the curve (AUC) 0.699 vs. 0.649, respectively, P = 0.239]. Epicardial layer circumferential strain analysis by Echo and by SENC allowed distinction of transmural from non-transmural myocardial infarction defined by LGE CMR with similar accuracy (AUC 0.721 vs. 0.664, respectively, P = 0.401). Endocardial strain by SENC correlated moderately with endocardial strain by Echo (r = 0.50; standard error of estimate = 5.2\%). CONCLUSION: Layer-specific analysis of myocardial deformation by Echo and by SENC allows discrimination between different transmurality categories of myocardial infarction with similar accuracy. However, accuracy of both methods is non-optimal, indicating that further tools for improvement should be evaluated in the future.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical ventricular reconstruction is a specific procedure designed to reduce left ventricular volume in patients with heart failure caused by coronary artery disease. We conducted a trial to address the question of whether surgical ventricular reconstruction added to coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) would decrease the rate of death or hospitalization for cardiac causes, as compared with CABG alone. METHODS: Between September 2002 and January 2006, a total of 1000 patients with an ejection fraction of 35\% or less, coronary artery disease that was amenable to CABG, and dominant anterior left ventricular dysfunction that was amenable to surgical ventricular reconstruction were randomly assigned to undergo either CABG alone (499 patients) or CABG with surgical ventricular reconstruction (501 patients). The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause and hospitalization for cardiac causes. The median follow-up was 48 months. RESULTS: Surgical ventricular reconstruction reduced the end-systolic volume index by 19\%, as compared with a reduction of 6\% with CABG alone. Cardiac symptoms and exercise tolerance improved from baseline to a similar degree in the two study groups. However, no significant difference was observed in the primary outcome, which occurred in 292 patients (59\%) who were assigned to undergo CABG alone and in 289 patients (58\%) who were assigned to undergo CABG with surgical ventricular reconstruction (hazard ratio for the combined approach, 0.99; 95\% confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.17; P=0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Adding surgical ventricular reconstruction to CABG reduced the left ventricular volume, as compared with CABG alone. However, this anatomical change was not associated with a greater improvement in symptoms or exercise tolerance or with a reduction in the rate of death or hospitalization for cardiac causes.

This allows us to treat the case of small and even disappearing barriers and, more importantly, to incorporate the mechanical representation of the power stroke into the theory of Brownian ratchets.

We treat the left ventricular myocardium as a non-homogeneous, thick-walled, nonlinearly elastic and incompressible material and develop a general theoretical framework based on invariants associated with the three directions. Within this framework we review existing constitutive models and then develop a structurally based model that accounts for the muscle fibre direction and the myocyte sheet structure. The model is applied to simple shear and biaxial deformations and a specific form fitted to the existing (and somewhat limited) experimental data, emphasizing the orthotropy and the limitations of biaxial tests. The need for additional data is highlighted. A brief discussion of issues of convexity of the model and related matters concludes the paper.},

To this end, different virtual cardiac fiber structures are modeled, and diffusion tensor imaging at multiple scales are simulated using the Monte Carlo method. The results show that the proposed modeling and simulation allow us to quantitatively describe the variation of the measured tissue properties (fiber orientation and fractional anisotropy) as a function of the observation scale.},

This approach was applied to SiC (Nicalon NLM 202 and Hi-Nicalon) fiber tows containing 500 filaments. It was shown that local load sharing was a preponderant factor that influenced tow strength data and the associated scatter. Implications in composite failure are finally discussed.},

  abstract = {Biventricular (BiV) finite element (FE) models of cardiac electromechanics are evolving to a state where they can assist in clinical decision making. Carefully designed patient-specific geometries are combined with generic myofiber orientation data, because of lack of accurate techniques to measure myofiber orientation. However, it remains unclear to what extent the assumption of a generic myofiber orientation influences predictions on cardiac function from BiV FE models. As an alternative approach, it was suggested to let the myofiber orientation adapt in response to fiber cross-fiber shear. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent variations in myofiber orientation as induced by adaptive myofiber reorientation caused variations in global stroke work in a BiV FE model and whether the adaptation model could be used as an alternative approach to prescribe the myofiber orientation in these models. An average change in myofiber orientation over an angle of about 8$\circ$, predominantly in transmural direction, resulted in a 91 \% increase of LV and 20 \% increase of RV stroke work. These findings indicate the importance for a more thorough effort to address a realistic myofiber orientation. The currently used model for adaptive myofiber reorientation seems a useful approach to prescribe the myofiber orientations in BiV FE models.},

The goal of this paper is to analyse delamination specimens within the framework of a damage meso-modelling of composite laminates. In this type of modelling a laminate is described as a stacking sequence of homogeneous layers and interlaminar interfaces. The interface is assumed to be damageable in order to model the delamination phenomena. In the case of the propagation of a pre-existing crack, the main parameters for the interface model identification are the critical energy release rates. Delamination specimens are here modelled as two beams connected by a damageable interface. By means of a Finite Element Scheme used in connection with a Riks-like algorithm; comparisons between numerical simulation and experiments have been performed for a wide class of specimens (D.C.B., E.N.F, E.L.S.). The results show the interest of the proposed modelling, which allows a complete simulation of delamination using of relatively little experimental data.},

While hypertrophy can eventually normalize wall tension, it is associated with an unfavorable outcome and threatens affected patients with sudden death or progression to overt heart failure. Accumulating evidence from studies in human patients and animal models suggests that in most instances hypertrophy is not a compensatory response to the change in mechanical load, but rather is a maladaptive process. Accordingly, modulation of myocardial growth without adversely affecting contractile function is increasingly recognized as a potentially auspicious approach in the prevention and treatment of heart failure. In this review, we summarize recent insights into hypertrophic signaling and consider several novel antihypertrophic strategies.},

  abstract = {Level set techniques are numerical techniques for tracking the evolution of inter- faces. They rely on two central embeddings; first, the embedding of the interface as the zero level set of a higher dimensional function, and second, the embedding (or extension) of the interface's velocity to this higher dimensional level set function. This paper applies Sethian's Fast Marching Method, which is a very fast technique for solving the eikonal and related equations, to the problem of building fast and appropriate extension velocities for the neighboring level sets. Our choice and con- struction of extension velocities serves several purposes. First, it provides a way of building velocities for neighboring level sets in the cases where the velocity is defined only on the front itself. Second, it provides a subgrid resolution not present in the standard level set approach. Third, it provides a way to update an interface according to a given velocity field prescribed on the front in such a way that the signed distance function is maintained, and the front is never re-initialized; this is valuable in many complex simulations. In this paper, we describe the details of such implementations, together with speed and convergence tests and applications to problems in visibility relevant to semi-conductor manufacturing and thin film physics.},

  abstract = {The microstructural deformation-mechanical loading relation of the blood vessel wall is essential for understanding the overall mechanical behavior of vascular tissue in health and disease. We employed simultaneous mechanical loading-imaging to quantify in situ deformation of individual collagen and elastin fibers on unstained fresh porcine coronary adventitia under a combination of vessel inflation and axial extension loading. Specifically, the specimens were imaged under biaxial loads to study microscopic deformation-loading behavior of fibers in conjunction with morphometric measurements at the zero-stress state. Collagen fibers largely orientate in the longitudinal direction, while elastin fibers have major orientation parallel to collagen, but with additional orientation angles in each sublayer of the adventitia. With an increase of biaxial load, collagen fibers were uniformly stretched to the loading direction, while elastin fibers gradually formed a network in sublayers, which strongly depended on the initial arrangement. The waviness of collagen decreased more rapidly at a circumferential stretch ratio of $\lambda$\${\th}eta\$ = 1.0 than at $\lambda$\${\th}eta\$ = 1.5, while most collagen became straightened at $\lambda$\${\th}eta\$ = 1.8. These microscopic deformations imply that the longitudinally stiffer adventitia is a direct result of initial fiber alignment, and the overall mechanical behavior of the tissue is highly dependent on the corresponding microscopic deformation of fibers. The microstructural deformation-loading relation will serve as a foundation for micromechanical models of the vessel wall.},

They exhibit mechanosensitive properties; they self-assemble upon application of pulling forces and dissociate when these forces are decreased. We rationalize this mechano-sensitivity from thermodynamic considerations and develop a continuum framework in which the cytoskeletal contractile forces generated by stress fibers drive the assembly of the FA multi-protein complexes. The FA model has three essential features: (i) the low and high affinity integrins co-exist in thermodynamic equilibrium, (ii) the low affinity integrins within the plasma membrane are mobile, and (iii) the contractile forces generated by the stress fibers are in mechanical equilibrium and change the free energies of the integrins. A general two-dimensional framework is presented and the essential features of the model illustrated using one-dimensional examples. Consistent with observations, the coupled stress fiber and FA model predict that (a) the FAs concentrate around the periphery of the cell; (b) the fraction of the cell covered by FAs increases with decreasing cell size while the total FA intensity increases with increasing cell size; and (c) the FA intensity decreases substantially when cell contractility is curtailed.},

  abstract = {Passive filling is a major determinant for the pump performance of the left ventricle and is determined by the filling pressure and the ventricular compliance. In the quantification of the passive mechanical behaviour of the left ventricle and its compliance, focus has been mainly on fiber orientation and constitutive parameters. Although it has been shown that the left-ventricular shape plays an important role in cardiac (patho-)physiology, the dependency on left-ventricular shape has never been studied in detail. Therefore, we have quantified the influence of left-ventricular shape on the overall compliance and the intramyocardial distribution of passive fiber stress and strain during the passive filling period. Hereto, fiber stress and strain were calculated in a finite element analysis of passive inflation of left ventricles with different shapes, ranging from an elongated ellipsoid to a sphere, but keeping the initial cavity volume constant. For each shape, the wall volume was varied to obtain ventricles with different wall thickness. The passive myocardium was described by an incompressible hyperelastic material law with transverse isotropic symmetry along the muscle fiber directions. A realistic transmural distribution in fiber orientation was assumed. We found that compliance was not altered substantially, but the transmural distribution of both passive fiber stress and strain was highly dependent on regional wall curvature and thickness. A low curvature wall was characterized by a maximum in the transmural fiber stress and strain in the mid-wall region, while a steep subendocardial transmural gradient was present in a high curvature wall. The transmural fiber stress and strain gradients in a low and high curvature wall were, respectively, flattened and steepened by an increase in wall thickness.},

Consequently, proper physiological studies and modeling necessitate a precise knowledge of the fiber orientation. Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging techniques have been used as a nondestructive means to characterize tissue fiber structure; however, the descriptions so far have been mostly qualitative. This study presents a direct, quantitative comparison of high-resolution MR fiber mapping and histology measurements in a block of excised canine myocardium. Results show an excellent correspondence of the measured fiber angles not only on a point-by-point basis (average difference of -2.30 +/- 0.98 degrees, n = 239) but also in the transmural rotation of the helix angles (average correlation coefficient of 0.942 +/- 0.008 with average false-positive probability of 0.004 +/- 0.001, n = 24). These data strongly support the hypothesis that the eigenvector of the largest MR diffusion tensor eigenvalue coincides with the orientation of the local myocardial fibers and underscore the potential of MR imaging as a noninvasive, three-dimensional modality to characterize tissue fiber architecture.},

An accelerated 3D complementary spatial modulation of magnetization (CSPAMM) tagging technique was used to modulate the myocardial tissue and to acquire 3D MR data sets of the whole-heart including three orthog- onal tags within three breath-holds. Each tag set is able to assess the motion along a direction perpendicular to the tag lines. With the application of CSPAMM, the effect of tag fading encountered in SPAMM tagging due to T1 relaxation is mitigated and tag deformations can be visualized for the entire cardiac cycle, including diastolic phases. In the proposed approach, the environment around each voxel in the 3D volume is modeled as a moving sine wavefront with local frequency and amplitude. The biggest advantage of the proposed technique is that the entire framework, from data acquisition to data analysis is in the 3D domain, which permits quantification of both the in-plane and through-plane motion components.

  abstract = {As the interaction between tissue adaptation and the mechanical condition within tissues is complex, mathematical models are desired to study this interrelation. In this study, a mathematical model is presented to investigate the interplay between collagen architecture and mechanical loading conditions in the arterial wall. It is assumed that the collagen fibres align along preferred directions, situated in between the principal stretch directions. The predicted fibre directions represent symmetrically arranged helices and agree qualitatively with morphometric data from literature. At the luminal side of the arterial wall, the fibres are oriented more circumferentially than at the outer side. The discrete transition of the fibre orientation at the media-adventitia interface can be explained by accounting for the different reference configurations of both layers. The predicted pressure-radius relations resemble experimentally measured sigma-shaped curves. As there is a strong coupling between the collagen architecture and the mechanical loading condition within the tissue, we expect that the presented model for collagen remodelling is useful to gain further insight into the processes involved in vascular adaptation, such as growth and smooth muscle tone adaptation. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Cine Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) provides accurate quantitative imaging of cardiac mechanics with rapid displacement and strain analysis; however, image acquisition times are relatively long. Compressed sensing (CS) with parallel imaging (PI) can generally provide high-quality images recovered from data sampled below the Nyquist rate. The purposes of the present study were to develop CS-PI-accelerated acquisition and reconstruction methods for cine DENSE, to assess their accuracy for cardiac imaging using retrospective undersampling, and to demonstrate their feasibility for prospectively-accelerated 2D cine DENSE imaging in a single breathhold. METHODS An accelerated cine DENSE sequence with variable-density spiral k-space sampling and golden angle rotations through time was implemented. A CS method, Block LOw-rank Sparsity with Motion-guidance (BLOSM), was combined with sensitivity encoding (SENSE) for the reconstruction of under-sampled multi-coil spiral data. Seven healthy volunteers and 7 patients underwent 2D cine DENSE imaging with fully-sampled acquisitions (14-26 heartbeats in duration) and with prospectively rate-2 and rate-4 accelerated acquisitions (14 and 8 heartbeats in duration). Retrospectively- and prospectively-accelerated data were reconstructed using BLOSM-SENSE and SENSE. Image quality of retrospectively-undersampled data was quantified using the relative root mean square error (rRMSE). Myocardial displacement and circumferential strain were computed for functional assessment, and linear correlation and Bland-Altman analyses were used to compare accelerated acquisitions to fully-sampled reference datasets. RESULTS For retrospectively-undersampled data, BLOSM-SENSE provided similar or lower rRMSE at rate-2 and lower rRMSE at rate-4 acceleration compared to SENSE (p $\backslash$textless 0.05, ANOVA). Similarly, for retrospective undersampling, BLOSM-SENSE provided similar or better correlation with reference displacement and strain data at rate-2 and better correlation at rate-4 acceleration compared to SENSE. Bland-Altman analyses showed similar or better agreement for displacement and strain data at rate-2 and better agreement at rate-4 using BLOSM-SENSE compared to SENSE for retrospectively-undersampled data. Rate-2 and rate-4 prospectively-accelerated cine DENSE provided good image quality and expected values of displacement and strain. CONCLUSIONS BLOSM-SENSE-accelerated spiral cine DENSE imaging with 2D displacement encoding can be acquired in a single breathhold of 8-14 heartbeats with high image quality and accurate assessment of myocardial displacement and circumferential strain.},

  abstract = {The composite textile reinforcement draping simulations allows the conditions for a successful process to be determined and, most importantly, the positions of the fibres after forming to be known. This last point is essential for the structural computations of the composite part and for resin injection analyses in the case of LCM processes. Because the textile composite reinforcements are multiscale materials, continuous (macro) approaches and discrete (meso) approaches that model the yarns have been developed. The finite element that is proposed in this paper for textile fabric forming is composed of woven unit cells. The mechanical behaviour of these is analyzed by 3D computations at the mesoscale regarding biaxial tensions and in plane shear. The warp and weft directions of the woven fabric can be in arbitrary direction with respect to the direction of the element side. This is very important in the case of multi-ply deep drawing and when using remeshing. The element is efficient because it is close to the physic of the woven cell while avoiding the very large number of unknowns in the discrete approach. A set of validation tests and forming simulations on single ply and multi-ply are presented and show the efficiency of the approach. In particular the importance of the in-plane shear behaviour is emphasized in the case of a draping on a cube.},

In response to the deposition of sarcomere units on the molecular level, the individual heart muscle cells increase in diameter, and the wall of the heart becomes progressively thicker. We present the underlying constitutive equations and their algorithmic implementation within an implicit nonlinear finite element framework. To demonstrate the features of the proposed approach, we study two classical growth phenomena in the heart: left and right ventricular wall thickening in response to systemic and pulmonary hypertension.},

A large number of methods for image registration are described in the literature. Unfortunately, there is not one method that works for all applications. We have therefore developed elastix, a publicly available computer program for intensity-based medical image registration. The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve medical image registration problems. The modular design of elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration methods for a specific application. The command-line interface enables automated processing of large numbers of data sets, by means of scripting. The usage of elastix for comparing different registration methods is illustrated with three example experiments, in which individual components of the registration method are varied.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new non-parametric combined segmentation and registration method. The shapes to be registered are implicitly modeled with level set functions and the problem is cast as an optimization one, combining a matching criterion based on the active contours without edges for segmentation (Chan and Vese, 2001) [8] and a nonlinear-elasticity-based smoother on the displacement vector field. This modeling is twofold: first, registration is jointly performed with segmentation since guided by the segmentation process; it means that the algorithm produces both a smooth mapping between the two shapes and the segmentation of the object contained in the reference image. Secondly, the use of a nonlinear-elasticity-type regularizer allows large deformations to occur, which makes the model comparable in this point with the viscous fluid registration method. In the theoretical minimization problem we introduce, the shapes to be matched are viewed as Ciarlet-Geymonat materials. We prove the existence of minimizers of the introduced functional and derive an approximated problem based on the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff stored energy for the numerical implementation and solved by an augmented Lagrangian technique. Several applications are proposed to demonstrate the potential of this method to both segmentation of one single image and to registration between two images. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The usual methodology used to address this inverse problem is based on the exploitation of the Green tensor of the linear elasticity problem in a half space (Boussinesq problem), coupled with a minimization algorithm under force penalization. A possible alternative strategy is to exploit an adjoint equation, obtained on the basis of a suitable minimization requirement. The resulting system of coupled elliptic partial differential equations is applied here to determine the force field per unit surface generated by T24 tumor cells on a polyacrylamide substrate. The shear stress obtained by numerical integration provides quantitative insight of the traction field and is a promising tool to investigate the spatial pattern of force per unit surface generated in cell motion, particularly in the case of such cancer cells.},

  volume = {285},
  abstract = {Structural remodeling of myocardium after infarction plays a critical role in functional adaptation. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTMRI) provides a means for rapid and nondestructive characterization of the three-dimensional fiber architecture of cardiac tissues. In this study, microscopic structural changes caused by MI were evaluated in Fischer 344 rats 4 wk after infarct surgery. DTMRI studies were performed on 15 excised, formalin-fixed rat hearts of both infarct (left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, n = 8) and control (sham, n = 7) rats. Infarct myocardium exhibited increased water diffusivity (41\% increase in trace values) and decreased diffusion anisotropy (37\% decrease in relative anisotropy index). The reduced diffusion anisotropy correlated negatively with microscopic fiber disarray determined by histological analysis (R = 0.81). Transmural courses of fiber orientation angles in infarct zones were similar to those of normal myocardium. However, regional angular deviation of the diffusion tensor increased significantly in the infarct myocardium and correlated strongly with microscopic fiber disarray (R = 0.86). These results suggest that DTMRI may provide a valuable tool for defining structural remodeling in diseased myocardium at the cellular and tissue level.},

We first introduce specific numerical treatments for the translation of image-based homogenization problems into a tensor framework. It includes the tensor approximations in suitable tensor formats of fields of material properties or indicator functions of multiple material phases recovered from segmented images. We then introduce some variants of proper generalized decomposition (PGD) methods for the construction of tensor decompositions in different tensor formats of the solution of boundary value problems. A new definition of PGD is introduced which allows the progressive construction of a Tucker decomposition of the solution. This tensor format is well adapted to the present application and improves convergence properties of tensor decompositions. Finally, we use a dual-based error estimator on quantities of interest which was recently introduced in the context of PGD. We exhibit its specificities when it is used for assessing the error on the homogenized properties of the heterogeneous material. We also provide a complete goal-oriented adaptive strategy for the progressive construction of tensor decompositions (of primal and dual solutions) yielding to predictions of homogenized quantities with a prescribed accuracy.},

  volume = {89},
  issn = {1552-6259},
  doi = {10.1016/j.athoracsur.2009.08.075},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Passive constraint is used to prevent left ventricular dilation and subsequent remodeling. However, there has been concern about the effect of passive constraint on diastolic left ventricular chamber stiffness and pump function. This study determined the relationship between constraint, diastolic wall stress, chamber stiffness, and pump function. We tested the hypothesis that passive constraint at 3 mm Hg reduces wall stress with minimal change in pump function. METHODS: A three-dimensional finite-element model of the globally dilated left ventricle based on left ventricular dimensions obtained in dogs that had undergone serial intracoronary microsphere injection was created. The model was adjusted to match experimentally observed end-diastolic left ventricular volume and midventricular wall thickness. The experimental results used to create the model were previously reported. A pressure of 3, 5, 7, and 9 mm Hg was applied to the epicardium. Fiber stress, end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship, end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, and the stroke volume-end-diastolic pressure (Starling) relationship were calculated. RESULTS: As epicardial constraint pressure increased, fiber stress decreased, the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship shifted to the left, and the Starling relationship shifted down and to the right. The end-systolic pressure-volume relationship did not change. A constraining pressure of 2.3 mm Hg was associated with a 10\% reduction in stroke volume, and mean end-diastolic fiber stress was reduced by 18.3\% (inner wall), 15.3\% (mid wall), and 14.2\% (outer wall). CONCLUSIONS: Both stress and cardiac output decrease in a linear fashion as the amount of passive constraint is increased. If the reduction in cardiac output is to be less than 10\%, passive constraint should not exceed 2.3 mm Hg. On the other hand, this amount of constraint may be sufficient to reverse eccentric hypertrophy after myocardial infarction.},

A methodology that constructs the enriched approximation from the interaction of the crack geometry with the mesh is developed. This technique allows the entire crack to be represented independently of the mesh, and so remeshing is not necessary to model crack growth.

  abstract = {The value of phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging for quantifying tissue motion and blood flow has been long recognized. However, the sensitivity of the method to system imperfections can lead to inaccuracies limiting its clinical acceptance. A key source of error relates to eddy current-induced phase fluctuations, which can offset the measured object velocity significantly. A higher-order dynamic field camera was used to study the spatiotemporal evolution of background phases in cine phase-contrast measurements. It is demonstrated that eddy current-induced offsets in phase-difference data are present up to the second spatial order. Oscillatory temporal behaviors of offsets in the kHz range suggest mechanical resonances of the MR system to be non-negligible in phase-contrast imaging. By careful selection of the echo time, their impact can be significantly reduced. When applying field monitoring data for correcting eddy current and mechanically induced velocity offsets, errors decrease to less than 0.5\% of the maximum velocity for various sequence settings proving the robustness of the correction approach. In vivo feasibility is demonstrated for aortic and pulmonary flow measurements in five healthy subjects. Using field monitoring data, mean error in stroke volume was reduced from 10\% to below 3\%.},

We studied the effect of microstructure on contraction in a computational model of rat left ventricular electromechanics. Different fibre models, globally rule-based or locally optimised to DT-MRI data, were compared, in order to understand whether a subject-specific fibre model would enhance the predictive power of our model with respect to the global ones. We also studied the impact of sheets on ventricular deformation by comparing: (a) a transversely isotropic versus an orthotropic material law and (b) a linear model with a bimodal model of sheet transmural variation. We estimated ejection fraction, wall thickening and base-to-apex shortening and compared them with measures from cine-MRI. We also evaluated Lagrangian strains as local metrics of cardiac deformation. Our results show that the subject-specific fibre model provides little improvement in the metric predictions with respect to global fibre models while material orthotropy allows closer agreement with measures than transverse isotropy. Nonetheless, the impact of sheets in our model is smaller than that of fibres. We conclude that further investigation of the modelling of sheet dynamics is necessary to fully understand the impact of tissue structure on cardiac deformation.},

  abstract = {Many have speculated that MRI signal characteristics can be used to identify regions of heterogeneous infarct associated with an arrhythmogenic substrate; however, direct evidence of this relationship is limited. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the remodelling characteristics of fibrosis by means of histology and high-resolution MR imaging. For this purpose, we performed whole-mount histology in heart samples (n = 9) collected from five swine at six weeks post-infarction and compared the extent of fibrosis in the infarcted areas delineated in these histological images with that obtained ex vivo by MRI using late gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods. All MR images were obtained at a submillimetre resolution (i.e., voxel size of 0.6\texttimes{}0.6\texttimes{}1.2 mm(3)). Specifically, in the histology images, we differentiated moderate fibrosis (consisting of a mixture of viable and non-viable myocytes, known as border zone, BZ) from severe fibrosis (i.e., the dense scar). Correspondingly, tissue heterogeneities in the MR images were categorized by a Gaussian mixture model into healthy, BZ and scar. Our results showed that (a) both MRI methods were capable of qualitatively distinguishing sharp edges between dense scar and healthy tissue from regions of heterogeneous BZ; (b) the BZ and dense scar areas had intermediate-to-high increased values of signal intensity in the LGE images and of apparent diffusion coefficient in the DWI, respectively. In addition, as demonstrated by the Picrosirius Red and immunohistochemistry stains, the viable bundles in the BZ were clearly separated by thin collagen strands and had reduced expression of Cx43, whereas the core scar was composed of dense fibrosis. A quantitative analysis demonstrated that the comparison between BZ/scar extent in LGE and DWI to the corresponding areas identified in histology yielded very good correlations (i.e., for the scar identified by LGE, R(2) was 0.96 compared to R(2) = 0.93 for the scar identified in ADC maps, whereas the BZ had R(2) = 0.95 for the correlation between LGE and histology compared to R(2) = 0.91 obtained for ADC). This novel study represents an intermediate step in translating such research to the in vivo stages, as well as in establishing the best and most accurate MR method to help identify arrhythmia substrate in patients with structural heart disease.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In light of the ongoing discussion about flow-mediated arterial remodeling, it was the aim of this report to demonstrate the detailed assessment of 3-dimensional vascular hemodynamics by high-field magnetic resonance imaging in healthy volunteers and to illustrate its potential in comparison with results in a patient with stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All examinations consisted of flow-sensitive 4-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. Retrospective blood flow visualization and segmental quantification of wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index were performed. The results from 11 healthy individuals were compared with a 13-year-old patient with aortic stenosis who received a combined protocol with time-resolved 3-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography before and 5 and 9 months after intervention. RESULTS: Evaluation of normal blood flow characteristics demonstrated predominantly right-handed helical flow in the ascending aorta. Vortex formation was observed in 1 of 11 volunteers. Consistently high segmental wall shear stress was found along the circumference of the ascending aorta (average wall shear stress = 0.191 +/- 0.06 N/m(2)) and descending aorta (average 0.191 +/- 0.06 N/m(2)). Compared with volunteers, the patient revealed substantial flow changes proximal and distal to the stenosis. Blood flow alterations in the ascending aorta were also observed associated with changes in velocities and wall shear stress that gradually normalized after intervention. CONCLUSION: Flow-sensitive 4-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla can provide deeper insights into hemodynamic alterations in the diagnosis and follow-up of aortic pathologies. These findings indicate the potential of the methodology for the evaluation of effects of localized pathologies on the entire vascular system, which will have to be confirmed in future studies.},

The anisotropic continuum damage theory introduced by Ladeveze is used. To identify the material constants and functions characterizing the studied 4D C/C material is a rather difficult task: fiber debonding near the edges is very important for tensile tests. To go further in the test analysis, large finite element computations have been done introducing a meso-modelling of the composite specimen, the meso-constituents being the fiber yarns, the matrix blocks and the interfaces.

  doi = {10.1118/1.2955743},
  abstract = {The authors develop a unique CT simulation tool based on the 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom, a whole-body computermodel of the human anatomy and physiology based on NURBS surfaces. Unlike current phantoms in CT based on simple mathematical primitives, the 4D XCAT provides an accurate representation of the complex human anatomy and has the advantage, due to its design, that its organ shapes can be changed to realistically model anatomical variations and patient motion. A disadvantage to the NURBS basis of the XCAT, however, is that the mathematical complexity of the surfaces makes the calculation of line integrals through the phantom difficult. They have to be calculated using iterative procedures; therefore, the calculation of CT projections is much slower than for simpler mathematical phantoms. To overcome this limitation, the authors used efficient ray tracing techniques from computer graphics, to develop a fast analytic projection algorithm to accurately calculate CT projections directly from the surface definition of the XCAT phantom given parameters defining the CT scanner and geometry. Using this tool, realistic high-resolution 3D and 4D projection images can be simulated and reconstructed from the XCAT within a reasonable amount of time. In comparison with other simulators with geometrically defined organs, the XCAT-based algorithm was found to be only three times slower in generating a projection data set of the same anatomical structures using a single 3.2 GHz processor. To overcome this decrease in speed would, therefore, only require running the projection algorithm in parallel over three processors. With the ever decreasing cost of computers and the rise of faster processors and multi-processor systems and clusters, this slowdown is basically inconsequential, especially given the vast improvement the XCAT offers in terms of realism and the ability to generate 3D and 4D data from anatomically diverse patients. As such, the authors conclude that the efficient XCAT-based CT simulator developed in this work will have applications in a broad range of CTimaging research.},

  abstract = {Heart failure continues to present a significant medical and economic burden throughout the developed world. Novel treatments involving the injection of polymeric materials into the myocardium of the failing left ventricle (LV) are currently being developed, which may reduce elevated myofiber stresses during the cardiac cycle and act to retard the progression of heart failure. A finite element (FE) simulation-based method was developed in this study that can automatically optimize the injection pattern of the polymeric "inclusions" according to a specific objective function, using commercially available software tools. The FE preprocessor TRUEGRID((R)) was used to create a parametric axisymmetric LV mesh matched to experimentally measured end-diastole and end-systole metrics from dogs with coronary microembolization-induced heart failure. Passive and active myocardial material properties were defined by a pseudo-elastic-strain energy function and a time-varying elastance model of active contraction, respectively, that were implemented in the FE software LS-DYNA. The companion optimization software LS-OPT was used to communicate directly with TRUEGRID((R)) to determine FE model parameters, such as defining the injection pattern and inclusion characteristics. The optimization resulted in an intuitive optimal injection pattern (i.e., the one with the greatest number of inclusions) when the objective function was weighted to minimize mean end-diastolic and end-systolic myofiber stress and ignore LV stroke volume. In contrast, the optimization resulted in a nonintuitive optimal pattern (i.e., 3 inclusions longitudinallyx6 inclusions circumferentially) when both myofiber stress and stroke volume were incorporated into the objective function with different weights.},

  abstract = {Some pathological conditions may affect osmolarity, which can impact cell, tissue, and organ volume. The hypothesis of this study is that changes in osmolarity affect the zero-stress state and mechanical properties of the aorta. To test this hypothesis, a segment of mouse abdominal aorta was cannulated in vivo and mechanically distended by perfusion of physiological salt (NaCl) solutions with graded osmolarities from 145 to 562 mosM. The mechanical (circumferential stress, strain, and elastic modulus) and morphological (wall thickness and wall area) parameters in the loaded state were determined. To determine the osmolarity-induced changes of zero-stress state, the opening angle was observed by immersion of the sectors of mouse, rat, and pig thoracic aorta in NaCl solution with different osmolarities. Wall volume and tissue water content of the rings were also recorded at different osmolarities. Our results show that acute aortic swelling due to low osmolarity leads to an increase in wall thickness and area, a change in the stress-strain relationship, and an increase in the elastic modulus (stiffness) in mouse aorta. The opening angle, wall volume, and water content decreased significantly with increase in osmolarity. These findings suggest that acute aortic swelling and shrinking result in immediate mechanical changes in the aorta. Osmotic pressure-induced changes in the zero-stress state may serve to regulate mechanical homeostasis.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To use diffusion-sensitive magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to obtain images of fiber orientation in vivo and to map fiber shortening in humans by means of integrating such data with strain images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Images of fiber shortening for midventricular short-axis sections were acquired in eight healthy subjects. Fiber orientation maps obtained by means of diffusion-sensitive MR imaging were coregistered with systolic strain maps obtained by means of velocity-sensitive MR imaging. Fiber shortening was quantified by use of the component of systolic strain in the fiber direction. RESULTS: The results were reproducible among subjects and were consistent with published values. MR imaging of myocardial fibers showed axisymmetric progression of fiber angles from -90 degrees epicardially to +90 degrees endocardially, with maxima near 0 degrees. Fiber shortening (mean, 0.12 +/- 0.01 [SD]) was more uniform than radial, circumferential, longitudinal, or cross-fiber strain or any principal strain. Fiber orientation coincided with the direction of maximum contraction epicardially, with that of minimum contraction endocardially, and varied between these extremes linearly with wall depth (r = 0.6). CONCLUSION: Registered diffusion and strain MR imaging can be used quantitatively to map fiber orientation and its relations to myocardial deformation in humans.},

Efforts to model and measure oxygen diffusion and consumption within these engineered tissues have sought to quantitatively assess and improve these design strategies.

Laminar shear stresses (range, 8-15 dynes/cm2; 24 hr) induced cell alignment in the direction of flow without initiating the cell cycle. In contrast, turbulent shear stresses as low as 1.5 dynes/cm2 for as short a period as 3 hr stimulated substantial endothelial DNA synthesis in the absence of cell alignment, discernible cell retraction, or cell loss. The results of these in vitro experiments suggest that in atherosclerotic lesion-prone regions of the vascular system, unsteady blood flow characteristics, rather than the magnitude of wall shear stress per se, may be the major determinant of hemodynamically induced endothelial cell turnover.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.cma.2013.08.009},
  abstract = {This paper deals with the offline resolution of nonlinear multiscale problems leading to a PGD-reduced model from which one can derive microinformation which is suitable for design. Here, we focus on an improvement to the Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) technique which is used for the calculation of the homogenized operator and which plays a central role in our multiscale computational strategy. This homogenized behavior is calculated offline using the LATIN multiscale strategy, and PGD leads to a drastic reduction in CPU cost. Indeed, the multiscale aspect of the LATIN method is based on splitting the unknowns between a macroscale and a microcomplement. This macroscale is used to capture the homogenized behavior of the structure and then to accelerate the convergence of the iterative algorithm. The novelty of this work lies in the reduction of the computation cost of building the homogenized operator. In order to do that, the problems defined within each subdomain are solved using a new PGD representation of the unknowns in which the separation of the unknowns is performed not only in time and in space, but also in terms of the interface macrodisplacements. The numerical example presented shows that the convergence rate of the approach is not affected by this new representation and that a significant reduction in computation cost can be achieved, particularly in the case of nonlinear behavior. The technique used herein is then particularly important to enhance the performances of the LATIN strategy but is not limited to this method. The more general path which is followed in this paper is to solve the microproblems arising in the homogenization for all the configurations that can be encountered in the calculation. An additional and novel benefit of this approach is that it includes the calculation of the homogenized tangent operator which gives, over the whole time interval and for any cell, the relation between the perturbation in terms of macroforces and the perturbation in terms of macrodisplacements. In linear viscoelasticity, this operator represents the homogenized behavior of the structure exactly.},

This multi-scale experimental device enabled simultaneous visualization of the collagen crimp morphology at the micrometer scale and measurement of macroscopic strain-stress response. We gradually increased the ultimate strain of the cycles and showed that preconditioning mostly occurs in the first stretching. This is accompanied by an increase of the crimp period in the SHG image. Our results indicate that preconditioning is due to a sliding of microstructures at the scale of a few fibrils and smaller, that changes the resting length of the fascicle. This sliding can reverse on long time scales. These results provide a proof of concept that continuous SHG imaging performed simultaneously with mechanical assay allows analysis of the relationship between macroscopic response and microscopic structure of tissues.},

This lack of a tailored software environment has hampered research progress, as well as dissemination of models and results. To address these issues, we developed the FEBio software suite (http://mrl.sci.utah.edu/software/febio), a nonlinear implicit finite element (FE) framework, designed specifically for analysis in computational solid biomechanics. This paper provides an overview of the theoretical basis of FEBio and its main features. FEBio offers modeling scenarios, constitutive models, and boundary conditions, which are relevant to numerous applications in biomechanics. The open-source FEBio software is written in C++, with particular attention to scalar and parallel performance on modern computer architectures. Software verification is a large part of the development and maintenance of FEBio, and to demonstrate the general approach, the description and results of several problems from the FEBio Verification Suite are presented and compared to analytical solutions or results from other established and verified FE codes. An additional simulation is described that illustrates the application of FEBio to a research problem in biomechanics. Together with the pre- and postprocessing software PREVIEW and POSTVIEW, FEBio provides a tailored solution for research and development in computational biomechanics.},

  abstract = {Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used in multiple clinical applications, but can still benefit from higher spatial or temporal resolution. A dynamic MR image reconstruction method from partial (k, t)-space measurements is introduced that recovers and inherently separates the information in the dynamic scene. The reconstruction model is based on a low-rank plus sparse decomposition prior, which is related to robust principal component analysis. An algorithm is proposed to solve the convex optimization problem based on an alternating direction method of multipliers. The method is validated with numerical phantom simulations and cardiac MRI data against state of the art dynamic MRI reconstruction methods. Results suggest that using the proposed approach as a means of regularizing the inverse problem remains competitive with state of the art reconstruction techniques. Additionally, the decomposition induced by the reconstruction is shown to help in the context of motion estimation in dynamic contrast enhanced MRI.},

It includes torsion around the axis of symmetry of the ventricle, transmural variation of fiber angle, and redistribution of intracoronary blood in the myocardial wall. In simulations, end-systolic principal strains were equal to 0.45, -0.01, and -0.24 at two-thirds of the wall thickness from the epicardium and 0.26, 0.00, and -0.19 at one-third of the wall thickness from the epicardium. The direction of maximal shortening varied by less than 30 degrees from epicardium to endocardium, whereas fiber direction varied by greater than 100 degrees from epicardium to endocardium. During a normal cardiac cycle peak, equatorial intramyocardial pressure differed by less than 5\% from peak intraventricular pressure. When redistribution of intracoronary blood in the ventricular wall was suppressed, peak equatorial intramyocardial pressure was found to exceed peak intraventricular pressure by greater than 30\%. Simulated contraction of an unloaded left ventricle (left ventricular pressure = 0 kPa) produced similar magnitude for systolic intramyocardial pressures as the normal cardiac cycle. Transmural systolic fiber stress distribution was very sensitive to the chosen transmural fiber angle distribution.},

  abstract = {While the primary function of the heart is a pump, ironically, the development of myofilament models that predict developed force have generally lagged behind the modeling of the electrophysiological and Ca2+-handling aspects of heart cells. A major impediment is that the basic events in force generating actin-myosin interactions are still not well understood and quantified despite advanced techniques that can probe molecular levels events and identify numerous energetic states. As a result, the modeler must decide how to best abstract the many identified states into useful models with an essential tradeoff in the level of complexity. Namely, complex models map more directly to biophysical states but experimental data does not yet exist to well constrain the rate constants and parameters. In contrast, parameters can be better constrained in simpler, lumped models, but the simplicity may preclude versatility and extensibility to other applications. Other controversies exist as to why the activation of the actin-myosin is so steeply dependent on activator Ca2+. More specifically steady-state force-[Ca2+] (F-Ca) relationships are similar to Hill functions, presumably as the result of cooperative interactions between neighboring crossbridges and/or regulatory proteins. We postulate that mathematical models must contain explicit representation of nearest-neighbor cooperative interactions to reproduce F-Ca relationships similar to experimental measures, whereas spatially compressing, mean-field approximation used in most models cannot. Finally, a related controversy is why F-Ca relationships show increased Ca2+ sensitivity as sarcomere length (SL) increases. We propose a model that suggests that the length-dependent effects can result from an interaction of explicit nearest-neighbor cooperative mechanisms and the number of recruitable crossbridges as a function of SL.},

The use of unstructured meshes, to exploit the full potential of FE-DIC in structural mechanics, is now widespread. Most of the time, the formulation, the quadrature and the definition of the region of interest still rely on the pixels grid. In this paper, a formulation in the physical coordinate system and not in the image frame is proposed for 2D digital image correlation. In addition to a more precise definition of the region of interest, it allows the use of a more accurate quadrature rule. It is also shown that lens distortions can be successfully taken into account directly with such a formalism.},

Active material parameters in the noninfarcted border zone (BZ) myocardium adjacent to the infarct (T(max\_B)), in the myocardium remote from the infarct (T(max\_R)), and in the infarct (T(max\_I)) were estimated by minimizing the errors between FE model-predicted and experimentally measured systolic strains and LV volumes using the previously developed optimization scheme. The optimized T(max\_B) was found to be significantly depressed relative to T(max\_R), while T(max\_I) was found to be zero. The myofiber stress in the BZ was found to be elevated, relative to the remote region. This could cause further damage to the contracting myocytes, leading to heart failure.},

  volume = {57},
  abstract = {Cardiac diffusion MRI based on stimulated-echo acquisition mode (STEAM) techniques is hampered by its inherent low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. Diffusion imaging using standard spin-echo (SE) techniques, on the other hand, offers higher SNRs but has been considered impractical for the beating heart due to excessive signal attenuation from cardiac bulk motion. In this work the effect of systolic cardiac motion on different diffusion-encoding schemes was studied in detail. Numerical simulations based on in vivo motion data (acquired by MRI tagging techniques) demonstrate an up to 10-fold decrease in bulk motion sensitivity of the diffusion encoding if the first-order moment of the diffusion-encoding gradients is nullified. It is shown that the remaining systolic phase pattern on the myocardium does not influence the magnitude images if the spatial resolution is chosen to be higher than 4 mm. Given these relatively low resolution requirements, we obtained in vivo diffusion-weighted (DW) short-axis images from four healthy volunteers using an SE-based diffusion-encoding sequence with excitation and refocusing in orthogonal planes for field of view (FOV) reduction. The results showed no significant signal loss due to cardiac motion, and the direction of the principal eigenvalues was found to be in good agreement with known myocardial fiber orientation.},

  abstract = {Background- Conducting channels are the target for ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation. Conducting channels could be identified with contrast enhanced-cardiac magnetic resonance (ce-CMR) as border zone (BZ) corridors. A 3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the ce-CMR could allow visualization of the 3D structure of these BZ channels. Methods and Results- We included 21 patients with healed myocardial infarction and VT. A 3D high-resolution 3T ce-CMR was performed before CARTO-guided VT ablation. The left ventricular wall was segmented and characterized using a pixel signal intensity algorithm at 5 layers (endocardium, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, epicardium). A 3D color-coded shell map was obtained for each layer to depict the scar core and BZ distribution. The presence/characteristics of BZ channels were registered for each layer. Scar area decreased progressively from endocardium to epicardium (scar area/left ventricular area: 34.0$\pm$17.4\% at endocardium, 24.1$\pm$14.7\% at 25\%, 16.3$\pm$12.1\% at 50\%, 13.1$\pm$10.4 at 75\%, 12.1$\pm$9.3\% at epicardium; P$\backslash$textless0.01). Forty-five BZ channels (2.1$\pm$1.0 per patient, 23.7$\pm$12.0 mm length, mean minimum width 2.5$\pm$1.5 mm) were identified, 85\% between the endocardium and 50\% shell and 76\% present in $\geq$1 layer. The ce-CMR-defined BZ channels identified 74\% of the critical isthmus of clinical VTs and 50\% of all the conducting channels identified in electroanatomic maps. Conclusions- Scar area in patients with healed myocardial infarction decreases from the endocardium to the epicardium. BZ channels, more commonly seen in the endocardium, display a 3D structure within the myocardial wall that can be depicted with ce-CMR. The use of ce-CMR-derived maps to guide VT ablation warrants further investigation.},

  abstract = {On the basis of the nonlinear theory of elasticity, the general constitutive equation for an isotropic hyperelastic solid in the presence of initial stress is derived. This derivation involves invariants that couple the deformation with the initial stress and in general, for a compressible material, it requires 10 invariants, reducing to 9 for an incompressible material. Expressions for the Cauchy and nominal stress tensors in a finitely deformed configuration are given along with the elasticity tensor and its specialization to the initially stressed undeformed configuration. The equations governing infinitesimal motions superimposed on a finite deformation are then used to study the combined effects of initial stress and finite deformation on the propagation of homogeneous plane waves in a homogeneously deformed and initially stressed solid of infinite extent. This general framework allows for various different specializations, which make contact with earlier works. In particular, connections with results derived within Biot's classical theory are highlighted. The general results are also specialized to the case of a small initial stress and a small pre-deformation, i.e. to the evaluation of the acoustoelastic effect. Here the formulas derived for the wave speeds cover the case of a second-order elastic solid without initial stress and subject to a uniaxial tension [Hughes and Kelly, Phys. Rev. 92 (1953) 1145] and are consistent with results for an undeformed solid subject to a residual stress [Man and Lu, J. Elasticity 17 (1987) 159]. These formulas provide a basis for acoustic evaluation of the second- and third-order elasticity constants and of the residual stresses. The results are further illustrated in respect of a prototype model of nonlinear elasticity with initial stress, allowing for both finite deformation and nonlinear dependence on the initial stress. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  issn = {0147-8389},
  abstract = {A 54-year-old man received a four chamber pacing system for severe congestive heart failure (NYHA functional Class IV). His ECG showed a left bundle branch block (200-msec QRS duration) with 200-msec PR interval, normal QRS axis, and 90-msec interatrial interval. An acute hemodynamic study with insertion of four temporary leads was performed prior to the implant, which demonstrated a significant increase in cardiac output and decrease of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. A permanent pacemaker was implanted based on the encouraging results of the acute study. The right chamber leads were introduced by cephalic and subclavian approaches. The left atrium was paced with a coronary sinus lead, Medtronic SP 2188-58 model. An epicardial Medtronic 5071 lead was placed on the LV free wall. The four leads were connected to a standard bipolar DDD pacemaker, Chorus 6234. The two atrial leads were connected via a Y-connector to the atrial channel of the pacemaker with a bipolar pacing configuration. The two ventricular leads were connected in a similar fashion to the ventricular channel of the device. The right chamber leads were connected to the distal poles. The left chamber leads were connected to the proximal poles of the pacemaker. Six weeks later, the patient's clinical status improved markedly with a weight loss of 17 kg and disappearance of peripheral edema. His functional class was reduced to NYHA II. Four chamber pacing is technically feasible. In patients with evidence of interventricular dyssynchrony, this original pacing mode probably provides a mechanical activation sequence closer to the natural one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Despite major advances in the treatment of heart failure, cardiogenic shock (CGS) remains associated with substantial mortality. Recent data suggest that the TandemHeart percutaneous ventricular assist device (pVAD) may be useful in the management of CGS. The aim of this prospective randomized study was to test the hypothesis that the TandemHeart (pVAD) provides superior hemodynamic support compared with intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP). METHODS: Forty-two patients from 12 centers presenting within 24 hours of developing CGS were included in the study and treated in an initial roll-in phase (n = 9) or randomized to treatment with IABP (n = 14) or TandemHeart pVAD (n = 19). Thirty patients (71\%) had persistent CGS despite having an IABP in place at the time of study enrollment. RESULTS: Cardiogenic shock was due to myocardial infarction in 70\% of the patients and decompensated heart failure in most of the remaining patients. The mean duration of support was 2.5 days. Compared with IABP, the TandemHeart pVAD achieved significantly greater increases in cardiac index and mean arterial blood pressure and significantly greater decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Overall 30-day survival and severe adverse events were not significantly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: In patients presenting within 24 hours of the development of CGS, TandemHeart significantly improves hemodynamic parameters, even in patients failing IABP. Larger-scale studies are required to assess the influence of improved hemodynamics on survival.},

It is shown that both methods provide the same qualitative and quantitative results for enough refined meshes. For the performed tests, E-FEM exhibited, in general, a higher accuracy, mostly for coarse meshes, whereas, convergence rate with mesh refinement, which is super-linear, showed slightly higher for X-FEM. As for the computational costs for single crack modelling X-FEM showed, depending on the case, from 1.1 to about 2.5 times more expensive than E-FEM. For multiple cracks, the computational cost of E-FEM keeps constant, whereas the cost associated to X-FEM increases linearly with the number of modelled cracks.},

  abstract = {Cartilage is a multi-phase material composed of fluid and electrolytes (68-85\% by wet weight), proteoglycans (5-10\% by wet weight), chondrocytes, collagen fibres and other glycoproteins. The solid phase constitutes an isotropic proteoglycan gel and a fibre network of predominantly type II collagen, which provides tensile strength and mechanical stiffness. The same two components control diffusion of the fluid phase, e.g. as visualised by diffusion tensor MRI: (i) the proteoglycan gel (giving a baseline isotropic diffusivity) and (ii) the highly anisotropic collagenous fibre network. We propose a new constitutive model and finite element implementation that focus on the essential load-bearing morphology: an incompressible, poroelastic solid matrix reinforced by an inhomogeneous, dispersed fibre fabric, which is saturated with an incompressible fluid residing in strain-dependent pores of the collagen-proteoglycan solid matrix. The inhomogeneous, dispersed fibre fabric of the solid further influences the fluid permeability, as well as an intrafibrillar portion that cannot be 'squeezed out' from the tissue. Using representative numerical examples on the mechanical response of cartilage, we reproduce several features that have been demonstrated experimentally in the cartilage mechanics literature.},

  abstract = {A sharp-interface numerical model is presented to simulate thermally driven crystal growth in three- dimensional space. The model is formulated using the finite element method and works directly with primitive variables. It solves the energy equation in a fixed volume mesh while explicitly tracking the motion of the solid\textendash{}liquid interface. The three-dimensional interface is represented by connected planar triangles that form a surface mesh. To accurately capture the morphology of the growing dendrite, the surface mesh is updated every few time-steps so that the quality of the triangles is maintained and the size of the triangles is always kept in a range associated with the element size of the fixed volume mesh. The interface curvature is calculated by a least-squares paraboloid-fitting to neighbouring nodes. The model is validated through a comparison with an exact solution of a three-dimensional Stefan problem, a mesh refinement study, a mesh orientation test and a comparison with solvability theory. It is shown that the interface position is tracked to second-order accuracy. Simulations are performed under different combinations of the undercooling and surface energy. The effects of these parameters on the growth and morphology of the dendrites are studied.},

For many common receptor-ligand systems, the ligands are tethered to a surface via polymeric spacers with finite binding range, thus adhesion cluster stability crucially depends on receptor-ligand distance. We introduce a one-step master equation which incorporates the effect of cooperative binding through a finite number of polymeric ligand tethers. We also derive Fokker-Planck and mean field equations as continuum limits of the master equation. Polymers are modeled either as harmonic springs or as worm-like chains. In both cases, we find bistability between bound and unbound states for intermediate values of receptor-ligand distance and calculate the corresponding switching times. For small cluster sizes, stochastic effects destabilize the clusters at large separation, as shown by a detailed analysis of the stochastic potential resulting from the Fokker-Planck equation.},

The characteristics of TE scaffolds are major concerns in the quest to fabricate ideal scaffolds. This paper identifies essential structural characteristics and the pre-requisites for fabrication techniques that can yield scaffolds that are capable of directing healthy and homogeneous tissue development. Emphasis is given to solid freeform (SFF), also known as rapid prototyping, technologies which are fast becoming the techniques of choice for scaffold fabrication with the potential to overcome the limitations of conventional manual-based fabrication techniques. SFF-fabricated scaffolds have been found to be able to address most, if not all the macro- and micro-architectural requirements for TE applications. This paper reviews the application/potential application of state-of-the-art SFF fabrication techniques in creating TE scaffolds. The advantages and limitations of the SFF techniques are compared.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vinculin and its isoform metavinculin are protein components of intercalated discs, structures that anchor thin filaments and transmit contractile force between cardiac myocytes. We tested the hypothesis that heritable dysfunction of metavinculin may contribute to the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed mutational analyses of the metavinculin-specific exon of vinculin in 350 unrelated patients with DCM. One missense mutation (Arg975Trp) and one 3-bp deletion (Leu954del) were identified. These mutations involved conserved amino acids, were absent in 500 control individuals, and significantly altered metavinculin-mediated cross-linking of actin filaments in an in vitro assay. Ultrastructural examination was performed in one patient (Arg975Trp), revealing grossly abnormal intercalated discs. A potential risk-conferring polymorphism (Ala934Val), identified in one DCM patient and one control individual, had a less pronounced effect on actin filament cross-linking. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide genetic and functional evidence for vinculin as a DCM gene and suggest that metavinculin plays a critical role in cardiac structure and function. Disruption of force transmission at the thin filament-intercalated disc interface is the likely mechanism by which mutations in metavinculin may lead to DCM.},

This rate dependence is shown to introduce an internal length scale into initial value problems. As a result, solutions of initial value problems that involve smeared cracking remain well posed. The width of the localization zone. where high strain rates are present, is proven to be independent of the finite element discretization. Convergence upon mesh refinement is also obtained for the consumption of energy in a cracked bar and the extent of wave reflection on a cracked zone. This is because in a rate-dependent medium, waves are dispersive and propagate with a real wave speed. Numerical results have been obtained for one-dimensional localization problems to substantiate these analytical findings.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the scalability of a time-space multiscale domain decomposition method in the framework of time-dependent nonlinear problems. The strategy which is being studied is the multiscale LATIN method, whose scalability was shown in previous works when the distinction between macro and micro parts is made on the spatial level alone. The objective of this work is to propose an explanation of the loss-of-scalability phenomenon, along with a remedy which guarantees full scalability provided a suitable macro time part is chosen. This technique, which is quite general, is based on an adaptive separation of scales which is achieved by adding the most relevant functions to the temporal macrobasis automatically. When this method is used, the numerical scalability of the strategy is confirmed by the examples presented.},

  doi = {10.1152/ajpheart.00571.2013},
  abstract = {It has been hypothesized that myofiber orientation adapts to achieve a preferred mechanical loading state in the myocardial tissue. Earlier studies tested this hypothesis in a combined model of left ventricular (LV) mechanics and remodeling of myofiber orientation in response to fiber cross-fiber shear, assuming synchronous timing of activation and uniaxial active stress development. Differences between computed and measured patterns of circumferential-radial shear strain E(cr) were assumed to be caused by limitations in either the LV mechanics model or the myofiber reorientation model. Therefore, we extended the LV mechanics model with a physiological transmural and longitudinal gradient in activation pattern and with triaxial active stress development. We investigated the effects on myofiber reorientation, LV function, and deformation. The effect on the developed pattern of the transverse fiber angle $\alpha$(t,0) and the effect on global pump function were minor. Triaxial active stress development decreased amplitudes of E(cr) towards values within the experimental range and resulted in a similar base-to-apex gradient during ejection in model computed and measured E(cr). The physiological pattern of mechanical activation resulted in better agreement between computed and measured strain in myofiber direction, especially during isovolumic contraction phase and first half of ejection. In addition, remodeling was favorable for LV pump and myofiber function. In conclusion, the outcome of the combined model of LV mechanics and remodeling of myofiber orientation is found to become more physiologic by extending the mechanics model with triaxial active stress development and physiological activation pattern.},

  doi = {10.1002/mrm.25418},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the influence of the diffusion weighting on in vivo cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) and obtain optimal parameters. METHODS: Ten subjects were scanned using stimulated echo acquisition mode echo planar imaging with six b-values, from 50 to 950 s$\cdot$mm(-2) , plus b = 15 s$\cdot$mm(-2) reference. The relationship between b-value and both signal loss and signal-to-noise ratio measures was investigated. Mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, and helical angle maps were calculated using all possible b-value pairs to investigate the effects of diffusion weighting on the main and reference data. RESULTS: Signal decay at low b-values was dominated by processes with high apparent diffusion coefficients, most likely microvascular perfusion. This effect could be avoided by diffusion weighting of the reference images. Parameter maps were improved with increased b-value until the diffusion-weighted signal approached the noise floor. For the protocol used in this study, b = 750 s$\cdot$mm(-2) combined with 150 s$\cdot$mm(-2) diffusion weighting of the reference images proved optimal. CONCLUSION: Mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, and helical angle from cDTI are influenced by the b-value of the main and reference data. Using optimal values improves parameter maps and avoids microvascular perfusion effects. This optimized protocol should provide greater sensitivity to pathological changes in parameter maps.

  abstract = {A damage mechanics model is presented to characterize brittle failure in elastic fiber-reinforced composite materials. An overall fourth-rank damage effect tensor is introduced based on the hypothesis of elastic energy equivalence to account for the overall damage of the composite system. In addition, two local (matrix and fiber) fourth-rank damage effect tensors are introduced to account for the local effects of damage experienced by both the matrix and the fibers. The overall and local damage tensors are correlated together using micromechanical considerations. The explicit constitutive equations for the damaged material are derived for a uniaxially loaded unidirectional thin fiber-reinforced composite lamina. The model is also applied to a unidirectional thin lamina under a state of plane stress. New expressions are derived for the stress and strain concentration factors for the damaged material in terms of the undamaged concentration factors and the damage variables. In addition, explicit expressions are obtained for the overall and local fourth-rank damage effect tensors. The research presented in this work is the three-dimensional generalization of the uniaxial tension model formulated previously by the authors.},

The emphasis is on theoretical models, but relevant experimental results also are discussed. As an aid to the reader, the fundamental biological terms and concepts are defined for the general problem and for each specific topic. At the outset, the processes involved in growth, remodeling, and morphogenesis are described and placed within the context of the evolution of species. Next, some of the analytical methods used in biomechanical models for these processes are presented. Then, applications of these and other techniques to specific systems are discussed, beginning at the cellular level and proceeding upward to the tissue and organ levels. At the cellular level, modeling and experimental studies are reviewed for cell division, cell movement, and pattern formation, and then morphogenetic mechanisms for epithelia (cell sheets) are discussed. At the tissue and organ levels, the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems are considered. Several models are described for growth, remodeling, and morphogenesis of bone, and mainly experimental results are examined in the cases of skeletal muscle, the heart, and arteries. Specific topics for the cardiovascular system include hypertrophy, residual stress, atherosclerosis, and embryonic development. Finally, some future research directions are suggested.},

  abstract = {Surgical therapies for heart failure that reduce left ventricular (LV) size have failed to improve LV function. Recent reports describe the direct injection of myocytes into the LV wall and suggest that myocyte transplantation improves regional contractile ability and improves LV function. Using a previously described finite element model, we simulated myocyte transplantation in the failing LV and tested the hypothesis that myocyte transplantation improves LV function (Starling relationship). An elastance model for active fiber stress was incorporated in an axisymmetric geometric model of the dilated, poorly contractile LV (dilated cardiomyopathy [DCM]). The nonlinear stress-strain relationship for the diastolic myocardium was anisotropic with respect to the local muscle fiber direction. Systolic material properties were depressed by assigning a peak intracellular calcium concentration (Ca2+) of 1.8 micromoL (normal value: 4.2 micromoL). Six different simulations of myocyte transplantation were performed in which transplanted areas were assigned a peak intracellular calcium concentration (Ca2+) of 4.2 micromoL. The pattern of myocyte engraftment was varied (transmural versus subepicardial; confluent versus heterogeneous), as was the amount of the LV free wall that was transplanted (17\% vs 33\%). Models were created and loaded with a range of physiologic LV pressures. Simulated myocyte transplantation increased the slope of the end-systolic elastance curve, improved the Starling relationship, and improved stroke volume and ejection fraction compared with DCM. This study demonstrated an improvement in LV function after myocyte transplantation.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.athoracsur.2010.08.010},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Restrictive mitral annuloplasty (RMA) is increasingly applied to treat functional mitral regurgitation in heart failure patients. Previous studies indicated beneficial clinical effects with low recurrence rates. However, the underlying pathophysiology is complex and outcome in terms of left ventricular function is not well known. We investigated chronic effects of RMA on ventricular function in relation to clinical outcome. METHODS: Heart failure patients (n = 11) with severe mitral regurgitation scheduled for RMA were analyzed at baseline (presurgery) and midterm follow-up by invasive pressure-volume loops, using conductance catheters. Clinical performance was evaluated by New York Heart Association class, quality-of-life-score, and 6-minute hall-walk-test. RESULTS: All patients were alive without recurrence of mitral regurgitation at follow-up (9.4 $\pm$ 4.1 months). Clinical parameters improved significantly (all p $\backslash$textless 0.05). Global cardiac function, assessed by cardiac output, stroke volume, and stroke work did not change after RMA. Reverse remodeling was demonstrated by decreased end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes (16\% and 11\%, both p $\backslash$textless 0.001). Systolic function improved, evidenced by increased ejection fraction (0.32 $\pm$ 0.05 to 0.36 $\pm$ 0.07, p = 0.001) and leftward shift of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESV(100): 116 $\pm$ 43 to 74 $\pm$ 26 mL, p $\backslash$textless 0.001). Diastolic function, however, demonstrated impairment by increased tau (69 $\pm$ 13 to 80 $\pm$ 14 ms, p $\backslash$textless 0.001) and stiffness constant (0.022 $\pm$ 0.022 to 0.031 $\pm$ 0.028 mL(-1), p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Restrictive mitral annuloplasty significantly improved clinical status without recurrence of mitral regurgitation at midterm follow-up in patients with heart failure. Hemodynamic analyses demonstrated significant reverse remodeling with unchanged global function and improved systolic function, but some signs of diastolic impairment. Overall, RMA appears an appropriate therapy for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and functional mitral regurgitation.},

  abstract = {The new SinMod method extracts motion from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-tagged (MRIT) image sequences. Image intensity in the environment of each pixel is modeled as a moving sine wavefront. Displacement is estimated at subpixel accuracy. Performance is compared with the harmonic-phase analysis (HARP) method, which is currently the most common method used to detect motion in MRIT images. SinMod can handle line tags, as well as speckle patterns. In artificial images (tag distance six pixels), SinMod detects displacements accurately (error $\backslash$textless 0.02 pixels). Effects of noise are suppressed effectively. Sharp transitions in motion at the boundary of an object are smeared out over a width of 0.6 tag distance. For MRIT images of the heart, SinMod appears less sensitive to artifacts, especially later in the cardiac cycle when image quality deteriorates. For each pixel, the quality of the sine-wave model in describing local image intensity is quantified objectively. If local quality is low, artifacts are avoided by averaging motion over a larger environment. Summarizing, SinMod is just as fast as HARP, but it performs better with respect to accuracy of displacement detection, noise reduction, and avoidance of artifacts.},

Unfortunately, our understanding of silks is limited because the complete elastic response has never been measured-leaving a stark lack of essential fundamental information. Using non-invasive, non-destructive Brillouin light scattering, we obtain the entire stiffness tensors (revealing negative Poisson's ratios), refractive indices, and longitudinal and transverse sound velocities for major and minor ampullate spider silks: Argiope aurantia, Latrodectus hesperus, Nephila clavipes, Peucetia viridans. These results completely quantify the linear elastic response for all possible deformation modes, information unobtainable with traditional stress-strain tests. For completeness, we apply the principles of Brillouin imaging to spatially map the elastic stiffnesses on a spider web without deforming or disrupting the web in a non-invasive, non-contact measurement, finding variation among discrete fibres, junctions and glue spots. Finally, we provide the stiffness changes that occur with supercontraction.},

The algorithm used volumetric MRI data to create a body force that deformed a finite element model of the LV over half of the cardiac cycle and tracked the tissue deformation. The accuracy of the computational predictions of strain were assessed by the creation of image data sets for which displacements between the images were known. A "forward" left ventricular FE model was given physiological loading and material properties. A loaded magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data set was created by displacing the end-systolic image MRI data set using the displacement values determined from the forward model. The strains computed from the forward and Warping solutions were compared. Further, PET images from a single patient were analyzed and compared to MRI-based Warping analysis results for the same patient at mid-ventricle and at the base of the LV. The fiber stretch distribution between the forward and warping solutions show good agreement, both in overall stretch distribution and for the stretch values on the image planes. The MRI and PET analyses showed similar stretch distributions indicating that strain distributions can be measured from PET images.},

  doi = {10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0573},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A major goal in bone engineering is the creation of large volume constructs (scaffolds and stem cells) that bear load. The scaffolds must satisfy two competing requirements\textendash{}they need be sufficiently porous to allow nutrient flow to maintain cell viability, yet sufficiently dense to bear load. We studied the effect of scaffold macroporosity on bone formation and scaffold strength, for bone formed by human bone marrow stromal cells. METHODS: Rigid cubical hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate scaffolds were produced by robo-casting. The ceramic line thickness was held constant, but the distance between adjacent lines was either 50, 100, 200, 500, or 1000 $\mu$m. Cultured human bone marrow stromal cells were combined with the scaffolds in vitro; transplants were placed into the subcutis of immunodeficient mice. Transplants were harvested 9, 18, 23, 38, or 50 weeks later. Bone formation and scaffold strength were analyzed using histology and compression testing. RESULTS: Sixty transplants were evaluated. Cortical bone increased with transplant age, and was greatest among 500 $\mu$m transplants. In contrast, maximum transplant strength was greatest among 200 $\mu$m transplants. CONCLUSIONS: Lamellar spacing within scaffolds regulates the extent of bone formation; 500 $\mu$m yields the most new bone, whereas 200 $\mu$m yields the strongest transplants.},

Interpretation of the data generated by this experimental technique is difficult, due to the complexity of the processes underlying cellular contractility and mechanotransduction. In the current study, a coupled framework that considers strain rate dependent contractility and remodeling of the cytoskeleton is used in tandem with a thermodynamic model of tension dependent focal adhesion formation to investigate the biomechanical response of cells adhered to micropost arrays. Computational investigations of the following experimental studies are presented: cell behavior on different sized arrays with a range of post stiffness; stress fiber and focal adhesion formation in irregularly shaped cells; the response of cells to deformations applied locally to individual posts; and the response of cells to equibiaxial stretching of micropost arrays. The predicted stress fiber and focal adhesion distributions; in addition to the predicted post tractions are quantitatively and qualitatively supported by previously published experimental data. The computational models presented in this study thus provide a framework for the design and interpretation of experimental micropost studies.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.11.038},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Linear repair of left ventricular aneurysm has been performed with mixed clinical results. By using finite element analysis, this study evaluated the effect of this procedure on end-systolic stress. METHODS: Nine sheep underwent myocardial infarction and aneurysm repair with a linear repair (13.4 +/- 2.3 weeks postmyocardial infarction). Satisfactory magnetic resonance imaging examinations were obtained in 6 sheep (6.6 +/- 0.5 weeks postrepair). Finite element models were constructed from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging-based cardiac geometry and postmortem measurement of myofiber helix angles using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. Material properties were iteratively determined by comparing the finite element model output with systolic tagged magnetic resonance imaging strain measurements. RESULTS: At the mid-wall, fiber stress in the border zone decreased by 39\% (sham = 32.5 +/- 2.5 kPa, repair = 19.7 +/- 3.6 kPa, P = .001) to the level of remote regions after repair. In the septum, however, border zone fiber stress remained high (sham = 31.3 +/- 5.4 kPa, repair = 23.8 +/- 5.8 kPa, P = .29). Cross-fiber stress at the mid-wall decreased by 41\% (sham = 13.0 +/- 1.5 kPa, repair = 7.7 +/- 2.1 kPa, P = .01), but cross-fiber stress in the un-excluded septal infarct was 75\% higher in the border zone than remote regions (remote = 5.9 +/- 1.9 kPa, border zone = 10.3 +/- 3.6 kPa, P $\backslash$textless .01). However, end-diastolic fiber and cross-fiber stress were not reduced in the remote myocardium after plication. CONCLUSION: With the exception of the retained septal infarct, end-systolic stress is reduced in all areas of the left ventricle after infarct plication. Consequently, we expect the primary positive effect of infarct plication to be in the infarct border zone. However, the amount of stress reduction necessary to halt or reverse nonischemic infarct extension in the infarct border zone and eccentric hypertrophy in the remote myocardium is unknown.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to investigate postinfarct left ventricular (LV) fiber structural alterations by ex vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a porcine heart model. In vivo cardiac MR imaging was first performed to measure ventricular function in six adult pigs with septal infarction near apex induced by the LAD ligation 13 weeks earlier. Hearts were then excised from the infarct pigs (n = 6) and six intact controls (n = 6) and fixed in formalin. High-resolution DTI was employed to examine changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and transmural helix angle distribution in the infarct, adjacent and remote regions as compared to the sham regions in the controls. FA values were found to decrease in the infarct and differ between the adjacent and remote regions. ADC increase in the infarct region was substantial, while changes in the adjacent and remote regions were insignificant. Structurally, the double-helix myocardial structure shifted toward more left-handed around the infarcted myocardium. Accordingly, the histological analysis revealed clear fiber structural degradation in the adjacent region. These findings confirmed the subtle alterations in the myocardial fiber quality and structure not only in the infarcted but also in the surrounding noninfarcted myocardium or borderzone.},

  abstract = {Concepts for ventricular function tend to assume that the majority of the myocardial cells are aligned with their long axes parallel to the epicardial ventricular surface. We aimed to validate the existence of aggregates of myocardial cells orientated with their long axis intruding obliquely between the ventricular epicardial and endocardial surfaces and to quantitate their amount and angulation. To compensate for the changing angle of the long axis of the myocytes relative to the equatorial plane of the ventricles with varying depths within the ventricular walls, the so-called helical angle, we used pairs of cylindrical knives of different diameters to punch semicircular slices from the left ventricular wall of pigs, the slices extending from the epicardium to the endocardium. The slices were pinned flat, fixed in formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, stained with azan or hematoxilin and eosin, and analyzed by a new semiautomatic procedure. We made use of new techniques in informatics to determine the number and angulation of the aggregates of myocardial cells cut in their long axis. The alignment of the myocytes cut longitudinally varied markedly between the epicardium and the endocardium. Populations of myocytes, arranged in strands, diverge by varying angles from the epicardial surface. When paired knives of decreasing diameter were used to cut the slices, the inclination of the diagonal created by the arrays increases, while the lengths of the array of cells cut axially decreases. The visualization of the size, shape, and alignment of the myocytic arrays at any side of the ventricular wall is determined by the radius of the knives used, the range of helical angles subtended by the alignment of the myocytes throughout the thickness of the wall, and their angulation relative to the epicardial surface. Far from the majority of the ventricular myocytes being aligned at angles more or less tangential to the epicardial lining, we found that three-fifths of the myocardial cells had their long axes diverging at angles between 7.5 and 37.5 degrees from an alignment parallel to the epicardium. This arrangement, with the individual myocytes supported by connective tissue, might control the cyclic rearrangement of the myocardial fibers. This could serve as an important control of both ventricular mural thickening and intracavitary shape.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.hrthm.2014.08.036},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Standard electroanatomic mapping systems use a single catheter to perform left ventricular substrate mapping. A new mapping system uses a 64-electrode mini-basket catheter to perform rapid automated acquisition of chamber geometry, voltage, and activation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of electroanatomic mapping using the basket catheter with that of mapping using a standard linear catheter in a swine model of chronic myocardial infarction. METHODS: Ten swine underwent left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion to create an anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Animals underwent delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and then detailed left ventricular voltage mapping with both the basket and the linear catheter. Map characteristics and scar area were compared between the basket catheter, linear catheter, and MRI. Induced ventricular tachycardia (VT) was mapped with the basket catheter. RESULTS: More points were acquired with the basket catheter than with the standard catheter (8762 $\pm$ 3164 vs 1712 $\pm$ 551; P $\backslash$textless .001). The fifth percentile of normal bipolar voltage distribution with the basket catheter was 1.54 mV. Using a bipolar voltage cutoff of 1.5 mV, the total infarct areas measured using the basket catheter, linear catheter, and MRI were similar (17.8 cm(2) vs 20.9 cm(2) vs 17.5 cm(2); P = .69); however, the correlation between MRI and catheter scar area measurement was best for the basket catheter (basket vs linear: r = .76 vs r = .71). In 3 animals, sustained poorly tolerated VT was initiated and the circuit mapped successfully with the basket catheter in $\backslash$textless5 minutes. CONCLUSION: Rapid substrate and activation mapping using a 64-electrode mini-basket catheter allows detailed voltage and activation mapping in postinfarction cardiomyopathy. This system may be useful for substrate and VT mapping in human postinfarction cardiomyopathy.},

  doi = {10.1016/0020-7683(95)00254-5},
  abstract = {A number of constitutive models have been proposed in recent years for elastic degradation and damage, many of which include procedures for the recovery of stiffness upon closure of tensile microcracks. Most of these recovery procedures are based on the decomposition of stress or strain into positive (tensile) and negative (compressive) components, which are incorporated in the elastic formulation taking recourse to fourth-order positive and negative projection operators. Due to the non-dissipative nature of microcrack closure-reopening for a certain fixed stale of degradation, the recovery formulation should possess a well-defined energy potential along the line of hyperelasticity, which conserves energy upon closed-loop load histories. This condition stems to have escaped the rapidly expanding literature on damage mechanics, i.e. closure formulations have nor been verified in this regards. In the paper, the (lack of) energy conservation is examined in terms of the spurious dissipation rate, which is developed for a relatively general class of recovery models. They include the positive-negative projection operators and the bimcdular formulations with different stiffnesses for tension and compression. It is shown that under proportional loading in strain or stress, all these formulations are energy conservative. Under non-proportional loading however, they are only conservative in conjunction with isotropic degradation, and they exhibit spurious dissipation-generation when anisotropic degradation is considered and the load history involves rotation of principal directions.

  abstract = {This paper presents a new three-dimensional electromechanical model of the two cardiac ventricles designed both for the simulation of their electrical and mechanical activity, and for the segmentation of time series of medical images. First, we present the volumetric biomechanical models built. Then the transmembrane potential propagation is simulated, based on FitzHugh-Nagumo reaction-diffusion equations. The myocardium contraction is modeled through a constitutive law including an electromechanical coupling. Simulation of a cardiac cycle, with boundary conditions representing blood pressure and volume constraints, leads to the correct estimation of global and local parameters of the cardiac function. This model enables the introduction of pathologies and the simulation of electrophysiology interventions. Moreover, it can be used for cardiac image analysis. A new proactive deformable model of the heart is introduced to segment the two ventricles in time series of cardiac images. Preliminary results indicate that this proactive model, which integrates a priori knowledge on the cardiac anatomy and on its dynamical behavior, can improve the accuracy and robustness of the extraction of functional parameters from cardiac images even in the presence of noisy or sparse data. Such a model also allows the simulation of cardiovascular pathologies in order to test therapy strategies and to plan interventions.},

  title = {The Design and Analysis of the {{Generalized Finite Element Method}}},
  volume = {181},
  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Finite Element Method (GFEM) as a combination of the classical Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Partition of Unity Method (PUM. The standard finite element spaces are augmented by adding special functions which reflect the known information about the boundary value problem and the input data, e.g., the singular functions obtained from the local asymptotic expansion of the exact solution in the neighborhood of a corner point, etc. The special functions are multiplied with the partition of unity corresponding to the standard linear vertex shape-functions and pasted together with the existing finite element basis to construct an augmented conforming finite element space. In this way, the local approximability afforded by the special functions is included in the approximation, while maintaining the existing infrastructure of finite element codes. The major features of the GFEM are: (1) the essential boundary conditions can be imposed exactly as in the standard FEM, unlike other partition of unity based methods where this is a major issue; (2) the accuracy of the numerical integration of the entries of the stiffness matrix and load vector is controlled adaptively so that the errors in integration of the special functions do not affect the accuracy of the constructed approximation (this issue also has not been sufficiently addressed in other implementations of partition of unity or meshless methods): and (3) linear dependencies in the system of equations are resolved by employing an easy modification of the direct linear solver. The power of the GFEM for solving problems in domains with complex geometry with less error and less computer resources than the standard FEM is illustrated by numerical examples.},

Using this method, it is shown that prospective nominal undersampling of up to 16 corresponding to a net acceleration factor of 8 including training data acquisition can be realized while keeping the error in stroke volume below 5\%. As a practical application, the acquisition of cine flow data in the aorta is demonstrated permitting assessment of two-dimensional velocity images and pulse wave velocities at 100 frames per second in a single breathhold per slice.},

DESIGN[\textemdash]Postal questionnaire survey of 99 adult patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, selected at random from a larger database (60.6\% response rate). Assessments included the short form 36 (SF-36) health survey, the hospital anxiety and depression scales, the sleep problems index, and a measure of psychological adjustment to cardiomyopathy. RESULTS[\textemdash]Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy reported significant impairments in physical functioning, role limitations owing to physical and emotional problems, social functioning, mental health, perceptions of general health, sleep, and vitality. Anxiety and depression levels were higher than in population samples. Impairment in several domains of quality of life was associated with low shortening fraction, high left ventricular end diastolic diameter, and the presence of heart failure and mitral regurgitation. Patients with familial cardiomyopathy had less impairment in quality of life than those with non-familial disease. Psychological adjustment scores were associated with several aspects of quality of life and emotional wellbeing. In multivariate analysis, demographic and clinical variables accounted for 0.1-40.7\% of the variance in different domains of quality of life, and psychological adjustment scores accounted for an additional 0.5-22.4\% of variance. CONCLUSIONS[\textemdash]Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy experience pronounced restrictions in quality of life and psychological wellbeing. These limitations are only partly accounted for by symptoms and the severity of underlying disease. Patients may benefit from efforts to improve psychological adjustment to the condition.},

The endomysium of such muscles transfers tension between overlapping myofibers, and is thus an elastic element in series with them. The endomysium of the cat biceps femoris contains curvilinear collagen fibrils in an approximately isotropic (random) array. The collagen fibrils undergo only a modest reorientation as the myofibers shorten or lengthen within the physiological range. A geometrical model predicts no change in the thickness of the endomysium on changing muscle fiber length and quantifies the expected collagen fibril reorientation in the endomysium as a function of muscle extension. It is also demonstrated that a high proportion of the collagen fibrils will be curvilinear at all sarcomere lengths. The organization of endomysial collagen is appropriate for the transfer of loads between myofibers by means of shear.},

Furthermore, these kinematic deformations have a feedback effect on the excitation properties of the medium. Electrical characteristics resemble basic models of cardiac excitation that have been used to successfully study mechanisms of reentrant cardiac arrhythmias in electrophysiology. We present a computational framework that employs electromechanical and mechanoelectric feedback to couple a three-variable FitzHugh-Nagumo-type excitation-tension model to the non-linear stress equilibrium equations, which govern large deformation hyperelasticity. Numerically, the coupled electromechanical model combines a finite difference method approach to integrate the excitation equations, with a Galerkin finite element method to solve the equations governing tissue mechanics. We present example computations demonstrating various effects of contraction on stationary rotating spiral waves and spiral wave break. We show that tissue mechanics significantly contributes to the dynamics of electrical propagation, and that a coupled electromechanical approach should be pursued in future electrophysiological modelling studies.},

  abstract = {Adherent cells generate forces through acto-myosin contraction to move, change shape, and sense the mechanical properties of their environment. They are thought to maintain defined levels of tension with their surroundings despite mechanical perturbations that could change tension, a concept known as tensional homeostasis. Misregulation of tensional homeostasis has been proposed to drive disorganization of tissues and promote progression of diseases such as cancer. However, whether tensional homeostasis operates at the single cell level is unclear. Here, we directly test the ability of single fibroblast cells to regulate tension when subjected to mechanical displacements in the absence of changes to spread area or substrate elasticity. We use a feedback-controlled atomic force microscope to measure and modulate forces and displacements of individual contracting cells as they spread on a fibronectin-patterned atomic-force microscope cantilever and coverslip. We find that the cells reach a steady-state contraction force and height that is insensitive to stiffness changes as they fill the micropatterned areas. Rather than maintaining a constant tension, the fibroblasts altered their contraction force in response to mechanical displacement in a strain-rate-dependent manner, leading to a new and stable steady-state force and height. This response is influenced by overexpression of the actin crosslinker $\alpha$-actinin, and rheology measurements reveal that changes in cell elasticity are also strain- rate-dependent. Our finding of tensional buffering, rather than homeostasis, allows cells to transition between different tensional states depending on how they are displaced, permitting distinct responses to slow deformations during tissue growth and rapid deformations associated with injury.},

  abstract = {Patients with heart failure and decreased function frequently develop discoordinate contraction because of electric activation delay. Often termed dyssynchrony, this further decreases systolic function and chamber efficiency and worsens morbidity and mortality. In the mid- 1990s, a pacemaker-based treatment termed cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) was developed to restore mechanical synchrony by electrically activating both right and left sides of the heart. It is a major therapeutic advance for the new millennium. Acute chamber effects of CRT include increased cardiac output and mechanical efficiency and reduced mitral regurgitation, whereas reduction in chamber volumes ensues more chronically. Patient candidates for CRT have a prolonged QRS duration and discoordinate wall motion, although other factors may also be important because $\approx$30\% of such selected subjects do not respond to the treatment. In contrast to existing pharmacological inotropes, CRT both acutely and chronically increases cardiac systolic function and work, yet it also reduces long-term mortality. Recent studies reveal unique molecular and cellular changes from CRT that may also contribute to this success. Heart failure with dyssynchrony displays decreased myocyte and myofilament function, calcium handling, $\beta$-adrenergic responsiveness, mitochondrial ATP synthase activity, cell survival signaling, and other changes. CRT reverses many of these abnormalities often by triggering entirely new pathways. In this review, we discuss chamber, circulatory, and basic myocardial effects of dyssynchrony and CRT in the failing heart, and we highlight new research aiming to better target and implement CRT, as well as leverage its molecular effects.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a benchmarking framework for the validation of cardiac motion analysis algorithms. The reported methods are the response to an open challenge that was put to the medical imaging community through a MICCAI workshop. The database included magnetic resonance (MR) and 3D ultrasound (3DUS) datasets from a dynamic phantom and 15 healthy volunteers. Participants processed 3D tagged MR datasets (3DTAG), cine steady state free precession MR datasets (SSFP) and 3DUS datasets, amounting to 1158 image volumes. Ground-truth for motion tracking was based on 12 landmarks (4 walls at 3 ventricular levels). They were manually tracked by two observers in the 3DTAG data over the whole cardiac cycle, using an in-house application with 4D visualization capabilities. The median of the inter-observer variability was computed for the phantom dataset (0.77mm) and for the volunteer datasets (0.84mm). The ground-truth was registered to 3DUS coordinates using a point based similarity transform. Four institutions responded to the challenge by providing motion estimates for the data: Fraunhofer MEVIS (MEVIS), Bremen, Germany; Imperial College London - University College London (IUCL), UK; Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain; Inria-Asclepios project (INRIA), France. Details on the implementation and evaluation of the four methodologies are presented in this manuscript. The manually tracked landmarks were used to evaluate tracking accuracy of all methodologies. For 3DTAG, median values were computed over all time frames for the phantom dataset (MEVIS = 1.20mm, IUCL = 0.73mm, UPF = 1.10mm, INRIA = 1.09mm) and for the volunteer datasets (MEVIS = 1.33mm, IUCL = 1.52mm, UPF = 1.09mm, INRIA = 1.32mm). For 3DUS, median values were computed at end diastole and end systole for the phantom dataset (MEVIS = 4.40mm, UPF = 3.48mm, INRIA = 4.78mm) and for the volunteer datasets (MEVIS = 3.51mm, UPF = 3.71mm, INRIA = 4.07mm). For SSFP, median values were computed at end diastole and end systole for the phantom dataset (UPF = 6.18mm, INRIA = 3.93mm) and for the volunteer datasets (UPF = 3.09mm, INRIA = 4.78mm). Finally, strain curves were generated and qualitatively compared. Good agreement was found between the different modalities and methodologies, except for radial strain that showed a high variability in cases of lower image quality.},

  doi = {10.1115/1.2979872},
  abstract = {Finite element (FE) implementations of nearly incompressible material models often employ decoupled numerical treatments of the dilatational and deviatoric parts of the deformation gradient. This treatment allows the dilatational stiffness to be handled separately to alleviate ill conditioning of the tangent stiffness matrix. However, this can lead to complex formulations of the material tangent moduli that can be difficult to implement or may require custom FE codes, thus limiting their general use. Here we present an approach, based on work by Miehe (Miehe, 1996, "Numerical Computation of Algorithmic (Consistent) Tangent Moduli in Large Strain Computational Inelasticity," Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng., 134, pp. 223-240), for an efficient numerical approximation of the tangent moduli that can be easily implemented within commercial FE codes. By perturbing the deformation gradient, the material tangent moduli from the Jaumann rate of the Kirchhoff stress are accurately approximated by a forward difference of the associated Kirchhoff stresses. The merit of this approach is that it produces a concise mathematical formulation that is not dependent on any particular material model. Consequently, once the approximation method is coded in a subroutine, it can be used for other hyperelastic material models with no modification. The implementation and accuracy of this approach is first demonstrated with a simple neo-Hookean material. Subsequently, a fiber-reinforced structural model is applied to analyze the pressure-diameter curve during blood vessel inflation. Implementation of this approach will facilitate the incorporation of novel hyperelastic material models for a soft tissue behavior into commercial FE software.},

  abstract = {The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the skin, which acts as a barrier membrane against the penetration of molecules into and out of the body. It has a biphasic structure consisting of keratinized cells (corneocytes) that are embedded in a lipid matrix. The macroscopic transport properties of the stratum corneum are functions of its microstructure and the transport properties of the corneocytes and the lipid matrix, and are of considerable interest in the context of transdermal drug delivery and quantifying exposure to toxins, as well as for determining the relation of skin disorders to disruption of the stratum corneum barrier. Due to the complexity of the tissue and the difference in length scales involved in its microstructure, a direct analysis of the mass transport properties of the stratum corneum is not feasible. In this study, we undertake an approach where the macroscopic diffusion tensor of the stratum corneum is obtained through homogenization using the method of asymptotic expansions. The biphasic structure of the stratum corneum is fully accounted for by allowing the corneocytes to be permeable and considering the partitioning between the corneocytes and the lipid phases. By systematically exploring the effect of permeable corneocytes on the macroscopic transport properties of the stratum corneum, we show that solute properties such as lipophilicity and relative permeabilities in the two phases have large effects on its transdermal diffusion behavior.},

  abstract = {With circulatory pathology, patient-specific simulation of hemodynamics is required to minimize invasiveness for diagnosis, treatment planning, and followup. We investigated the advantages of a smart combination of often already known hemodynamic principles. The CircAdapt model was designed to simulate beat-to-beat dynamics of the four-chamber heart with systemic and pulmonary circulation while incorporating a realistic relation between pressure-volume load and tissue mechanics and adaptation of tissues to mechanical load. Adaptation was modeled by rules, where a locally sensed signal results in a local action of the tissue. The applied rules were as follows: For blood vessel walls, 1) flow shear stress dilates the wall and 2) tensile stress thickens the wall; for myocardial tissue, 3) strain dilates the wall material, 4) larger maximum sarcomere length increases contractility, and 5) contractility increases wall mass. The circulation was composed of active and passive compliances and inertias. A realistic circulation developed by self-structuring through adaptation provided mean levels of systemic pressure and flow. Ability to simulate a wide variety of patient-specific circumstances was demonstrated by application of the same adaptation rules to the conditions of fetal circulation followed by a switch to the newborn circulation around birth. It was concluded that a few adaptation rules, directed to normalize mechanical load of the tissue, were sufficient to develop and maintain a realistic circulation automatically. Adaptation rules appear to be the key to reduce dramatically the number of input parameters for simulating circulation dynamics. The model may be used to simulate circulation pathology and to predict effects of treatment.},

The materials are characterized by well-defined pore connectivity along with directional and completely open porosity. Various parameters affecting the porosity and compressive strength have been investigated, including initial slurry concentration, freezing rate, and sintering conditions. The implications and potential application as bone substitute are discussed. These results might open the way for hydroxyapatite-based materials designed for load-bearing applications.

  doi = {10.1007/s10237-013-0544-6},
  abstract = {Complex 3D beating heart models are now available, but their complexity makes calibration and validation very difficult tasks. We thus propose a systematic approach of deriving simplified reduced-dimensional models, in "0D"-typically, to represent a cardiac cavity, or several coupled cavities-and in "1D"-to model elongated structures such as muscle samples or myocytes. We apply this approach with an earlier-proposed 3D cardiac model designed to capture length-dependence effects in contraction, which we here complement by an additional modeling component devised to represent length-dependent relaxation. We then present experimental data produced with rat papillary muscle samples when varying preload and afterload conditions, and we achieve some detailed validations of the 1D model with these data, including for the length-dependence effects that are accurately captured. Finally, when running simulations of the 0D model pre-calibrated with the 1D model parameters, we obtain pressure-volume indicators of the left ventricle in good agreement with some important features of cardiac physiology, including the so-called Frank-Starling mechanism, the End-Systolic Pressure-Volume Relationship, as well as varying elastance properties. This integrated multi-dimensional modeling approach thus sheds new light on the relations between the phenomena observed at different scales and at the local versus organ levels.},

Peak velocities and peak turbulent kinetic energies of more than 3 m/s and 1000 J/m(3) could be generated.

  abstract = {BackgroundPreterm birth leads to a switch from fetal to postnatal circulation before completion of in utero cardiac development. We hypothesised that those born preterm would have a unique adult cardiac phenotype and that this would develop during postnatal life. Methods234 young adults underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance, of which 102 had been followed prospectively since preterm birth. We then studied 200 infants, longitudinally from birth to three months of age using echocardiography, of which 111 were born preterm. To define cardiac shape and function in adult and neonatal life we developed in-house 3D computational approaches and applied novel deformation imaging tools. Results born preterm had increased LV and RV mass index (P $\backslash$textless 0.001 and P $\backslash$textless 0.001), proportional to severity of prematurity (P = 0.03 and P $\backslash$textless 0.001), and reduced chamber volumes and length (P $\backslash$textless 0.01). Although LV ejection fraction was preserved, RV ejection fraction was reduced (P = 0.006), as were LV systolic and diastolic myocardial deformation. At birth, preterm-born infants had similar LV mass index, appropriate for gestational body size, as term-born infants (P = 0.13). However, by three months a greater percentage increase (P = 0.01) resulted in significantly greater LV mass index in those born preterm (P = 0.04). Interestingly, their LV end-diastolic volume index was already smaller at birth (P = 0.003) and this difference persisted at three months (P = 0.05). ConclusionsBirth is associated with a unique adult cardiac phenotype. Disproportionate increases in mass occur during postnatal life alongside persistent shape changes. Postnatal life may be a critical window for modification of cardiac development, relevant to the adult cardiovasculature.},

  abstract = {Ice formation in aqueous solutions and suspensions involves a number of significant changes and processes in the residual liquid. The resulting effects were described concerning the redistribution of dissolved salts, the behaviour of gaseous solutes and bubble formation, the rejection and entrapment of second-phase particles. This set of conditions is also experienced by biological cells subjected to freezing. The influences of ice formation in that respect and their relevance for cryopreservation were considered as well. A model of transient heat conduction and solute diffusion with a planar ice front, propagating through a system of finite length was found to be in good agreement with measured salt concentration profiles. The spacing of the subsequently developing columnar solidification pattern was of the same order of magnitude as the pertubation wavelengths predicted from the stability criterion. Non-planar solidification of binary salt solutions was described by a pure heat transfer model under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium. The rejection of gaseous solutes and the resulting gas concentration profile ahead of a planar ice front has been estimated by means of a test bubble method, yielding a distribution coefficient of 0.05 for oxygen. The nucleation of gas bubbles has been observed to occur at slightly less than 20-fold supersaturation. The subsequent radial growth of the bubbles obeys a square-root time dependence as expected from a diffusion controlled model until the still expanding bubbles become engulfed by the advancing ice-liquid interface. The maximum bubble radii decrease for increasing ice front velocities. The transition between repulsion and entrapment of spherical latex particles by an advancing planar ice-front has been characterized by a critical value of the velocity of the solidification interface. The critical velocity is inversely proportional to the particle radius as suggested by models assuming an undisturbed ice front. The increase of the critical velocity for increasing thermal gradients shows good agreement with a theoretically predicted square-root type of dependence. Critical velocities have also been measured for yeast and red blood cells. The effect of freezing on biological cells has been analyzed for human lymphocytes and erythrocytes. The reduction of cell volume observed during non-planar freezing agrees reasonably well with shrinkage curves calculated from a water transport model. The probability of intracellular ice formation has been characterized by threshold cooling rates above which the amount of water remaining within the cell is sufficient for crystallization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Laminar, or sheet, architecture of the left ventricle (LV) is a structural basis for normal systolic and diastolic LV dynamics, but transmural sheet orientations remain incompletely characterized. We directly measured the transmural distribution of sheet angles in the ovine anterolateral LV wall. Ten Dorsett-hybrid sheep hearts were perfusion fixed in situ with 5\% buffered glutaraldehyde at end diastole and stored in 10\% formalin. Transmural blocks of myocardial tissue were excised, with the edges cut parallel to local circumferential, longitudinal, and radial axes, and sliced into 1-mm-thick sections parallel to the epicardial tangent plane from epicardium to endocardium. Mean fiber directions were determined in each section from five measurements of fiber angles. Each section was then cut transverse to the fiber direction, and five sheet angles (beta) were measured and averaged. Mean fiber angles progressed nearly linearly from -41 degrees (SD 11) at the epicardium to +42 degrees (SD 16) at the endocardium. Two families of sheets were identified at approximately +45 degrees (beta(+)) and -45 degrees (beta(-)). In the lateral region (n = 5), near the epicardium, sheets belonged to the beta(+) family; in the midwall, to the beta(-) family; and near the endocardium, to the beta(+) family. This pattern was reversed in the basal anterior region (n = 4). Sheets were uniformly beta(-) over the anterior papillary muscle (n = 2). These direct measurements of sheet angles reveal, for the first time, alternating transmural families of predominant sheet angles. This may have important implications in understanding wall mechanics in the normal and the failing heart.},

A frame-invariant formulation of Fung elasticity is provided for material symmetries ranging from orthotropy to isotropy, which uses Lam{\'e}-like material constants. In the orthotropic case, three orthonormal vectors are used to define mutually orthogonal planes of symmetry and associated texture tensors. The strain energy density is then formulated as an isotropic function of the Lagrangian strain and texture tensors. The cases of isotropy and transverse isotropy are derived from the orthotropic case. Formulations are provided for both material and spatial frames. These formulations are suitable for implementation into finite element codes. It is also shown that the strain energy function can be naturally uncoupled into a dilatational and a distortional part, to facilitate the computational implementation of incompressibility.},

Effects of the material degradation on the elastic characteristics of the composite are considered, and it is shown that the state of degradation of a material is determined by two damage surfaces, one associated with the effective section and one associated with the effective volume. Fourier series expansions are used to describe the composites. The use of homogenization techniques in determining the local distribution of stresses and strains is also discussed. Analysis of the two composites considered reveals the presence of two damage mechanisms, one related to the damage of the layers which is due to the degradation of the matrix and the fiber-matrix union, and one related to damage of the interface.},

The resulting gels were used to print scaffolds by robocasting without the use of binder to increase the viscosity of the paste. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that the process yielded hydroxyapatite and $\beta$-tricalcium phosphate biphasic composite powders. Thus, the scaffold composition after crystallization of the amorphous structure could be easily modified by varying the initial Ca/P ratio during synthesis. The compressive strengths of the scaffolds are $\sim$6 MPa, which is in the range of human cancellous bone (2-12 MPa). These highly porous scaffolds ($\sim$73 vol\% porosity) are composed of macro-pores of $\sim$260 $\mu$m in size; such porosity is expected to enable bone ingrowth into the scaffold for bone repair applications. The chemistry, porosity, and surface topography of such scaffolds can also be modified by the process parameters to favor bone formation. The studied sol-gel process can be used to coat these scaffolds by dip-coating, which induces a significant enhancement of mechanical properties. This can adjust scaffold properties such as composition and surface morphology, which consequently may improve their performances.},

This occurs as a consequence of leaflet tethering due to posterior papillary muscle displacement. METHODS: A finite element model of the left ventricle, mitral apparatus, and chordae tendineae was created from magnetic resonance images from a sheep that developed moderate mitral regurgitation after posterobasal myocardial infarction. Each region of the model was characterized by a specific constitutive law that captured the material response when subjected to physiologic pressure loading. RESULTS: The model simulation produced a gap between the posterior and anterior leaflets, just above the infarcted posterior papillary muscle, which is indicative of mitral regurgitation. When the stiffness of the infarct region was reduced, this caused the wall to distend and the gap area between the leaflets to increase by 33\%. Additionally, the stress in the leaflets increased around the chordal connection points near the gap. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology outlined in this work will allow a finite element model of both the left ventricle and mitral valve to be generated using noninvasive techniques.},

  abstract = {Background: Contractility in the borderzone (BZ) after anteroapical myocardial infarction (MI) is depressed. We tested the hypothesis that BZ contractility is also decreased after posterolateral MI. Methods: Five sheep underwent posterolateral MI. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed 2 weeks before and 16 weeks after MI, and left ventricular (LV) volume and regional strain were measured. Finite element (FE) models were constructed, and the systolic material parameter, Tmax, was calculated in the BZ and remote myocardium by minimizing the difference between experimentally measured and calculated LV strain and volume. Sheep were sacrificed 17 weeks after MI, and myocardial muscle fibers were taken from the BZ and remote myocardium. Fibers were chemically demembranated, and isometric developed force, F max, was measured at supramaximal [Ca2+]. Routine light microscopy was also performed. Results: There was no difference in T max in the remote myocardium before and 16 weeks after MI. However, there was a large decrease (63.3\%, p = 0.005) in Tmax in the BZ when compared with the remote myocardium 16 weeks after MI. In addition, there was a significant reduction of BZ Fmax for all samples (18.9\%, p = 0.0067). Myocyte cross-sectional area increased by 61\% (p = 0.021) in the BZ, but there was no increase in fibrosis. Conclusions: Contractility in the BZ is significantly depressed relative to the remote myocardium after posterolateral MI. The reduction in contractility is due at least in part to a decrease in contractile protein function. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.},

  abstract = {To determine whether acute left ventricular failure associated with myocardial infarction leads to architectural changes in the spared nonischemic portion of the ventricular wall, large infarcts were produced in rats, and the animals were killed 2 days after surgery. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased, whereas left ventricular dP/dt and systolic pressure were decreased, indicating the presence of severe ventricular dysfunction. Absolute infarct size, determined by measuring the fraction of myocyte nuclei lost from the left ventricular free wall, averaged 63\%. Transverse midchamber diameter increased by 20\%, and wall thickness diminished by 33\%. The mural number of myocytes in this spared region of the left ventricular free wall decreased by 36\% and the capillary profiles by 40\%. The combination of these functional abnormalities and structural rearrangement of the wall resulted in a 7.8-fold increase in diastolic wall stress. A comparable analysis of the interventricular septum demonstrated a 24\% reduction in the number of cells across the septal thickness, whereas capillaries were diminished by 26\%. Moreover, a 7.2-fold elevation in diastolic stress was computed in this region of the ventricle. The augmentation in diastolic stress was associated with a 22\% and a 16\% myocyte cellular hypertrophy in the wall and septum, respectively. In conclusion, side-to-side slippage of myocytes in the myocardium occurs in association with ventricular dilatation after a large myocardial infarction and contributes to ventricular remodeling and the occurrence of decompensated eccentric hypertrophy.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.031},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: During cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) occurs at the junctional complex with the T-tubules, containing the L-type Ca2+ channels. A partial loss of T-tubules has been described in myocytes from failing canine and human hearts. We examined how graded reduction of T-tubule density would affect the synchrony of Ca2+ release. METHODS: Adult pig ventricular myocytes were isolated and cultured for 24 and 72 h. T-tubules, visualized with di-8-ANEPPS, and [Ca2+]i transients (Fluo-3) were recorded during confocal line scan imaging. RESULTS: Cultured cardiomyocytes exhibited a progressive reduction in T-tubule density. [Ca2+]i transients showed small areas of delayed Ca2+ release which gradually increased in number and size with loss of T-tubules. Local [Ca2+]i transients in the delayed regions were reduced. Due to these changes, loss of T-tubules resulted in an overall slowing of the rise of [Ca2+] along the entire line scan and transient magnitude tended to be reduced, but there was no change in SR Ca2+ content. Human myocytes isolated from failing hearts had a T-tubule density comparable to that of freshly isolated pig myocytes. The size, but not the number, of delayed release areas tended to be larger. The overall rate of rise of [Ca2+]i was significantly faster than in pig myocytes with low T-tubule density. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of T-tubules reduces the synchrony of SR Ca2+ release. This could contribute to reduced efficiency of excitation-contraction coupling in heart failure, though dyssynchrony in human failing cells appears to be modest.},

However, these techniques involve a high number of approximation functions. In the finite element framework, widely used in complex flow simulations, each approximation function is related to a node that defines the associated degree of freedom. When the model involves high dimensional spaces (including physical and conformation spaces and time), standard discretization techniques fail due to an excessive computation time required to perform accurate numerical simulations. One appealing strategy that allows circumventing this limitation is based on the use of reduced approximation basis within an adaptive procedure making use of an efficient separation of variables.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.12.022},
  abstract = {Skin displays an impressive functional plasticity, which allows it to adapt gradually to environmental changes. Tissue expansion takes advantage of this adaptation, and induces a controlled in situ skin growth for defect correction in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Stretches beyond the skin's physiological limit invoke several mechanotransduction pathways, which increase mitotic activity and collagen synthesis, ultimately resulting in a net gain in skin surface area. However, the interplay between mechanics and biology during tissue expansion remains unquantified. Here, we present a continuum model for skin growth that summarizes the underlying mechanotransduction pathways collectively in a single phenomenological variable, the strain-driven area growth. We illustrate the governing equations for growing biological membranes, and demonstrate their computational solution within a nonlinear finite element setting. In displacement-controlled equi-biaxial extension tests, the model accurately predicts the experimentally observed histological, mechanical, and structural features of growing skin, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Acute and chronic elastic uniaxial stretches are 25\% and 10\%, compared to 36\% and 10\% reported in the literature. Acute and chronic thickness changes are -28\% and -12\%, compared to -22\% and -7\% reported in the literature. Chronic fractional weight gain is 3.3, compared to 2.7 for wet weight and 3.3 for dry weight reported in the literature. In two clinical cases of skin expansion in pediatric forehead reconstruction, the model captures the clinically observed mechanical and structural responses, both acutely and chronically. Our results demonstrate that the field theories of continuum mechanics can reliably predict the mechanical manipulation of thin biological membranes by controlling their mechanotransduction pathways through mechanical overstretch. We anticipate that the proposed skin growth model can be generalized to arbitrary biological membranes, and that it can serve as a valuable tool to virtually manipulate living tissues, simply by means of changes in the mechanical environment.},

  abstract = {As an initial step to investigate stimulus-response relations in growth and remodeling (G\&R) of cardiac tissue, this study aims to develop a method to simulate 3D-inhomogeneous volumetric growth. Growth is regarded as a deformation that is decomposed into a plastic component which describes unconstrained growth and an elastic component to satisfy continuity of the tissue after growth. In current growth models, a single reference configuration is used that remains fixed throughout the entire growth process. However, considering continuous turnover to occur together with growth, such a fixed reference is unlikely to exist in reality. Therefore, we investigated the effect of tissue turnover on growth by incrementally updating the reference configuration. With both a fixed reference and an updated reference, strain-induced cardiac growth in magnitude of 30\% could be simulated. However, with an updated reference, the amplitude of the stimulus for growth decreased over time, whereas with a fixed reference this amplitude increased. We conclude that, when modeling volumetric growth, the choice of the reference configuration is of great importance for the computed growth.},

  abstract = {A general automatic approach is presented for accommodating local shape variation when mapping a two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) template image into alignment with a topologically similar target image. Local shape variability is accommodated by applying a vector-field transformation to the underlying material coordinate system of the template while constraining the transformation to be smooth (globally positive definite Jacobian). Smoothness is guaranteed without specifically penalizing large-magnitude deformations of small subvolumes by constraining the transformation on the basis of a Stokesian limit of the fluid-dynamical Navier-Stokes equations. This differs fundamentally from quadratic penalty methods, such as those based on linearized elasticity or thin-plate splines, in that stress restraining the motion relaxes over time allowing large-magnitude deformations. Kinematic nonlinearities are inherently necessary to maintain continuity of structures during large-magnitude deformations, and are included in all results. After initial global registration, final mappings are obtained by numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations associated with the constrained optimization problem. Automatic regridding is performed by propagating templates as the nonlinear transformations evaluated on a finite lattice become singular. Application of the method to intersubject registration of neuroanatomical structures illustrates the ability to account for local anatomical variability.},

Human myofiber and sheet architecture is modeled using eigenvectors computed from diffusion tensor MR images from an isolated, fixed human organ-donor heart and transformed to the patient-specific geometric model using large deformation diffeomorphic mapping. Semi-automated methods were developed for optimizing the passive material properties while simultaneously computing the unloaded reference geometry of the ventricles for stress analysis. Material properties of active cardiac muscle contraction were optimized to match ventricular pressures measured by cardiac catheterization, and parameters of a lumped-parameter closed-loop model of the circulation were estimated with a circulatory adaptation algorithm making use of information derived from echocardiography. These components were then integrated to create a multi-scale model of the patient-specific heart. These methods were tested in five heart failure patients from the San Diego Veteran's Affairs Medical Center who gave informed consent. The simulation results showed good agreement with measured echocardiographic and global functional parameters such as ejection fraction and peak cavity pressures.},

  abstract = {A bio-chemo-mechanical model has been used to predict the contractile responses of smooth cells on a bed of micro-posts. Predictions obtained for smooth muscle cells reveal that, by converging onto a single set of parameters, the model captures all of the following responses in a self-consistent manner: (i) the scaling of the force exerted by the cells with the number of posts; (ii) actin distributions within the cells, including the rings of actin around the micro-posts; (iii) the curvature of the cell boundaries between the posts; and (iv) the higher post forces towards the cell periphery. Similar correspondences between predictions and measurements have been demonstrated for fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells once the maximum stress exerted by the stress fibre bundles has been recalibrated. Consistent with measurements, the model predicts that the forces exerted by the cells will increase with both increasing post stiffness and cell area (or equivalently, post spacing). In conjunction with previous assessments, these findings suggest that this framework represents an important step towards a complete model for the coupled bio-chemo-mechanical responses of cells.},

  abstract = {A set of three-dimensional constitutive equations is proposed for modeling the nonlinear dissipative response of soft tissue. These constitutive equations are phenomenological in nature and they model a number of physical features that have been observed in soft tissue. The equations model the tissue as a composite of a purely elastic component and a dissipative component, both of which experience the same total dilatation and distortion. The stress response of the purely elastic component depends on dilatation, distortion and the stretch of material fibers, whereas the stress response of the dissipative component depends on distortional deformation only. The equations are hyperelastic in the sense that the stress is obtained by derivatives of a strain energy function, and they are properly invariant under superposed rigid body motions. In contrast with standard viscoelastic models of tissues, the proposed constitutive model includes the total deformation rate in evolution equations that can reproduce the observed physical feature that the hysteresis loops of most biological soft tissues are nearly independent of strain rate (Biomechanics, Mechanical Properties of Living Tissues, second ed. (1993)). Material constants are determined which produce good agreement with uniaxial stress experiments on superficial musculoaponeurotic system and facial skin.},

The study is based on displacement error assessment from synthetic speckle images. Series of synthetic reference and deformed images with random patterns have been generated, assuming a sinusoidal displacement field with various frequencies and amplitudes. Displacements are evaluated by several DIC packages based on various formulations and used in the French community. Evaluated displacements are compared with the exact imposed values and errors are statistically analyzed. Results show general trends rather independent of the implementations but strongly correlated with the assumptions of the underlying algorithms. Various error regimes are identified, for which the dependence of the uncertainty with the parameters of the algorithms, such as subset size, gray level interpolation or shape functions, is discussed.},

We tested the hypothesis that SAVER increases stroke volume, reduces mean myofiber stress and achieves optimal results without a patch. METHODS: A finite element model of the left ventricle (LV) with an akinetic but contractile anteroapical LV wall segment was used. Separate versions of the model with normal and dilated LV sizes were developed and used to simulate the SAVER operation with and without a patch of varying stiffness from 10 to 100 kilopascals. RESULTS: The SAVER operation reduced myofiber stress in the akinetic infarct and infarct borderzone, but caused a reduction in the Starling relationship. In all cases, stroke volume decreased while ejection fraction increased after SAVER. The SAVER operation was more beneficial in dilated ventricles, and the reduction in stroke volume after SAVER without patch was minimal. The effect of patch stiffness was mixed as stiffer material causes a greater reduction in stress yet has the greatest negative effect on stroke volume. CONCLUSIONS: These simulations support the use of SAVER in dilated hearts without a patch.},

  issn = {1081-2865},
  doi = {10.1177/1081286514551504},
  abstract = {Tetanized muscle myofibrils are often modeled as one-dimensional chains where springs represent half-sarcomeres (HS). The force-length relation for individual HSs (isometric tetanus) is known to have a descending limb', a segment with an apparently negative stiffness. Despite the potential mechanical instability on the descending limb, the isometric tetanus is usually interpreted as describing an affine deformation. At the same time, active stretching during tetanus around the descending limb is known to produce non-affine sarcomere patterns. In view of this paradox, the question whether the mechanical behavior of a myofibril can be interpreted as a response of a single contractile unit has been a subject of considerable controversy over the last 50 years. In this paper we question the claim that the isometric tetanus describes homogeneous configurations of the HS chain. To distinguish between the multitudes of non-affine equilibrium states available to this mechanical system, we propose to use the concept of a stored mechanical energy. While the notion of energy is natural from a mechanical point of view, physiologists have resisted it so far on the grounds that the contractile elements are active. We discuss how this objection can be overcome and show that the appropriately defined stored energy of a tetanized myofibril with N contractile units has exponentially many local minima. We then argue that the ruggedness of the ensuing energy landscape is responsible for the experimentally observed history dependence and hysteresis in the mechanical response of a tetanized muscle near the descending limb. A nonlocal extension of the chain model, accounting for surrounding tissues, shows that both the ground states and the marginally stable states are fine mixtures of short and long HSs. These mixtures are homogeneous at the macro-scale and inhomogeneous at the micro-scale and we show that the negative overall slope of the step-wise tetanus can coexist with a positive instantaneous stiffness. A salient feature of the nonlocal model is that the variation of the degree of non-uniformity with elongation follows a complete devil's staircase.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that two populations of myocardial fibres-fibres aligned parallel to the surfaces of the wall and an additional population of fibres that extend obliquely through the wall-when working in concert produce a dualistic, self stabilising arrangement. METHODS: Assessment of tensile forces in the walls of seven porcine hearts by using needle probes. Ventricular diameter was measured with microsonometry and the intracavitary pressure through a fluid filled catheter. Positive inotropism was induced by dopamine, and negative inotropism by thiopental. The preload was raised by volume load and lowered by withdrawal of blood. Afterload was increased by inflation of a balloon in the aortic root. The anatomical orientation of the fibres was established subsequently in histological sections. RESULTS: The forces in the fibres parallel to the surface decreased 20-35\% during systolic shrinkage of the ventricle, during negative inotropism, and during ventricular unloading. They increased 10-30\% on positive inotropic stimulation and with augmentation in preload and afterload. The forces in the oblique transmural fibres increased 8-65\% during systole, on positive inotropic medication, with an increase in afterload and during ventricular shrinkage, and decreased 36\% on negative inotropic medication. There was a delay of up to 147 ms in the drop in activity during relaxation in the oblique transmural fibres. CONCLUSION: Although the two populations of myocardial fibres are densely interwoven, it is possible to distinguish their functions with force probes. The delayed drop in force during relaxation in obliquely oriented fibres indicates that they are hindered in their shortening to an extent that parallels any increase in mural thickness. The transmural fibres, therefore, contribute to stiffening of the ventricular wall and hence to confining ventricular compliance.},

  abstract = {`Fluid buckling' is a phenomenon characterized mainly by the existence of fluid toroidal oscillations during flow. It appears when a high viscosity fluid flows vertically against a flat surface and may occur in industrial applications, as in injection molding of a propergol in complex-shaped cavities. These coiling or folding oscillations appear during the mold filling stage, leading to air entrapment. To understand and to model this free surface flow problem, a convected level set method is proposed. First, a sinus filter is applied to the distance function to get a smooth truncation far from the interface. Second, the reinitialization is embedded in the transport equation model, avoiding it as a separate step during calculation. In order to validate the method, numerical results are presented on classical interface capturing benchmarks. Finally, results are shown on two-dimensional and three-dimensional viscous jet buckling problems.},

The safety factors needed to ensure it have so far been assessed empirically. For perfectly ductile and perfectly brittle structures, the empirical approach is sufficient because the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of random material strength is known and fixed. However, such an approach is insufficient for structures consisting of quasibrittle materials, which are brittle materials with inhomogeneities that are not negligible compared with the structure size. The reason is that the strength cdf of quasibrittle structure varies from Gaussian to Weibullian as the structure size increases. In this article, a recently proposed theory for the strength cdf of quasibrittle structure is refined by deriving it from fracture mechanics of nanocracks propagating by small, activation-energy-controlled, random jumps through the atomic lattice. This refinement also provides a plausible physical justification of the power law for subcritical creep crack growth, hitherto considered empirical. The theory is further extended to predict the cdf of structural lifetime at constant load, which is shown to be size- and geometry-dependent. The size effects on structure strength and lifetime are shown to be related and the latter to be much stronger. The theory fits previously unexplained deviations of experimental strength and lifetime histograms from the Weibull distribution. Finally, a boundary layer method for numerical calculation of the cdf of structural strength and lifetime is outlined.},

Ceramic matrix composites (CMC) are good candidates for structural applications at high temperatures in oxidizing environments. A main question is then to be able to predict, that is, to compute the lifetime of engineering structures. Multiphysic models are needed to reproduce couplings between the mechanical and environmental fields. The chapter is first focused on the central and crucial question of highly anisotropic materials as CMCs: how does one handle mathematically what we call damage, that is, how does one reproduce the microcracking mechanisms? The answer described here is a general anisotropic damage theory that takes into account crack closure effects. The second part deals with the modeling of couplings with the environment characterized by temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and humidity. Fatigue of interface, matrix and fiber oxidation, and self-healing mechanisms are also taken into account. The idea, here, is to develop micro-multiphysic models that provide information for the computational macromodel. This strategy is illustrated on a self-healing CMC material. The last part concerns the use of the computational multiphysic model, which allows one to predict the macrocracks' initiation and their propagation. Classical numerical difficulties are displayed and answers are given. To end, an application to an engineering structure is shown.},

  abstract = {Surgical ventricular restoration (SVR) is a procedure designed to treat heart failure by surgically excluding infarcted tissues from the dilated failing left ventricle. To elucidate and predict the effects of geometrical changes from SVR on cardiac function, we created patient-specific mathematical (finite-element) left ventricular models before and after surgery using untagged magnetic resonance images. Our results predict that the postsurgical improvement in systolic function was compromised by a decrease in diastolic distensibility in patients. These two conflicting effects typically manifested as a more depressed Starling relationship (stroke volume vs. end-diastolic pressure) after surgery. By simulating a restoration of the left ventricle back to its measured baseline sphericity, we show that both diastolic and systolic function improved. This result confirms that the increase in left ventricular sphericity commonly observed after SVR (endoventricular circular patch plasty) has a negative impact and contributes partly to the depressed Starling relationship. On the other hand, peak myofiber stress was reduced substantially (by 50\%) after SVR, and the resultant left ventricular myofiber stress distribution became more uniform. This significant reduction in myofiber stress after SVR may help reduce adverse remodeling of the left ventricle. These results are consistent with the speculation proposed in the Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure trial (20) for the neutral outcome, that "the lack of benefit seen with surgical ventricular reconstruction is that benefits anticipated from surgical reduction of left ventricular volume (reduced wall stress and improvement in systolic function) are counter-balanced by a reduction in diastolic distensibility."},

  abstract = {Based on the concept of the effective stress and on the description of anisotropic damage deformation within the framework of continuum damage mechanics, a fourth order damage effective tensor is properly defined. For a general state of deformation and damage, it is seen that the effective stress tensor is usually asymmetric. Its symmetrization is necessary for a continuum theory to be valid in the classical sense. In order to transform the current stress tensor to a symmetric effective stress tensor, a fourth order damage effect tensor should be defined such that it follows the rules of tensor algebra and maintains a physical description of damage. Moreover, an explicit expression of the damage effect tensor is of particular importance in order to obtain the constitutive relation in the damaged material. The damage effect tensor in this work is explicitly characterized in terms of a kinematic measure of damage through a second-order damage tensor. In this work, tensorial forms are used for the derivation of such a linear transformation tensor which is then converted to a matrix form.},

The quasi-brittle failure mechanisms are described by the spatial truss representation, which is defined by the chosen Voronoi mesh. In order to explicitly incorporate heterogeneities with no need to change this mesh, some bar elements are cut by the phase-interface and must be split into two parts. Any such element is enhanced using both weak and strong discontinuities, based upon the Incompatible Mode Method. Furthermore, a dedicated operator split solution procedure is proposed to keep local any additional computation on elements with embedded discontinuities. The results for several numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the proposed model to provide an excellent representation of failure mechanisms for any different macroscopic loading path.},

Accuracy of reported helix angles is limited. Reported transverse angle data are incomplete.

A novel local wall-bound coordinate system was derived from the characteristics of the fiber field. The transmural course of the helix angle corresponded to data reported in literature. The mean midwall transverse angle ranged from -12 +/- 4 degrees near the apex to +9.0 +/- 4 degrees near the base of the left ventricle, which is in agreement with the course predicted by Rijcken et al. (18) using a uniform load hypothesis. The divergence of the myofiber field was computed, which is a measure for the extent to which wall stress is transmitted through the myofiber alone.

The strength distribution of the stacked layers is obtained by an application of the statistical theory of bundles of filaments after Daniels and others, and `weakest link' statistics are used to yield the strength distribution of the cylindrical bodies. For comparison, the `weakest link' statistics of Epstein and others are given for the second case which corresponds to the usual cleavage fracture model of brittle materials.

  abstract = {The Parachute(\textregistered) (Cardiokinetix, Inc., Menlo Park, California) is a catheter-based device intended to reverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling after antero-apical myocardial infarction. When deployed, the device partitions the LV into upper and lower chambers. To simulate its mechanical effects, we created a finite element LV model based on computed tomography (CT) images from a patient before and 6 months after Parachute(\textregistered) implantation. Acute mechanical effects were determined by in silico device implantation (VIRTUAL-Parachute). Chronic effects of the device were determined by adjusting the diastolic and systolic material parameters to better match the 6-month post-implantation CT data and LV pressure data at end-diastole (ED) (POST-OP). Regional myofiber stress and pump function were calculated in each case. The principal finding is that VIRTUAL-Parachute was associated with a 61.2 \% reduction in the lower chamber myofiber stress at ED. The POST-OP model was associated with a decrease in LV diastolic stiffness and a larger reduction in myofiber stress at the upper (27.1 \%) and lower chamber (78.4 \%) at ED. Myofiber stress at end-systole and stroke volume was little changed in the POST-OP case. These results suggest that the primary mechanism of Parachute(\textregistered) is a reduction in ED myofiber stress, which may reverse eccentric post-infarct LV hypertrophy.},

The aim of this work was to demonstrate how much perfusion contributes to the ADC and to present a method for obtaining separate images of diffusion and perfusion. Images were obtained at 0.5 T with high-resolution multisection sequences and without the use of contrast material. Results in a phantom made of resin microspheres demonstrated the ability of the method to separately evaluate diffusion and perfusion. The method was then applied in patients with brain and bone tumors and brain ischemia. Clinical results showed significant promise of the method for tissue characterization by perfusion patterns and for functional studies in the evaluation of the microcirculation in physiologic and pathologic conditions, as, for instance, in brain ischemia.},

  abstract = {Functional mitral regurgitation, a backward leakage of the mitral valve, is a result of left ventricular growth and mitral annular dilatation. Its gold standard treatment is mitral annuloplasty, the surgical reduction in mitral annular area through the implantation of annuloplasty rings. Recurrent regurgitation rates may, however, be as high as 30\% and more. While the degree of annular downsizing has been linked to improved long-term outcomes, too aggressive downsizing increases the risk of ring dehiscences and significantly impairs repair durability. Here, we prototype a virtual sizing tool to quantify changes in annular dimensions, surgically induced tissue strains, mitral annular stretches, and suture forces in response to mitral annuloplasty. We create a computational model of dilated cardiomyopathy onto which we virtually implant annuloplasty rings of different sizes. Our simulations confirm the common intuition that smaller rings are more invasive to the surrounding tissue, induce higher strains, and require larger suture forces than larger rings: The total suture force was 2.2 N for a 24-mm ring, 1.9 N for a 28-mm ring, and 0.8 N for a 32-mm ring. Our model predicts the highest risk of dehiscence in the septal and postero-lateral annulus where suture forces are maximal. These regions co-localize with regional peaks in myocardial strain and annular stretch. Our study illustrates the potential of realistic predictive simulations in cardiac surgery to identify areas at risk for dehiscence, guide the selection of ring size and shape, rationalize the design of smart annuloplasty rings and, ultimately, improve long-term outcomes after surgical mitral annuloplasty.},

  abstract = {Extracellular matrix remodelling plays an essential role in tissue engineering of load-bearing structures. The goal of this study is to model changes in collagen fibre content and orientation in soft connective tissues due to mechanical stimuli. A theory is presented describing the mechanical condition within the tissue and accounting for the effects of collagen fibre alignment and changes in fibre content. A fibre orientation tensor is defined to represent the continuous distribution of collagen fibre directions. A constitutive model is introduced to relate the fibre configuration to the macroscopic stress within the material. The constitutive model is extended with a structural parameter, the fibre volume fraction, to account for the amount of fibres present within the material. It is hypothesised that collagen fibre reorientation is induced by macroscopic deformations and the amount of collagen fibres is assumed to increase with the mean fibre stretch. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated by considering remodelling within a biaxially stretched cube. The model is then applied to analyse remodelling within a closed stented aortic heart valve. The computed preferred fibre orientation runs from commissure to commissure and resembles the fibre directions in the native aortic valve. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Left ventricular dynamics, coronary blood flow (Vcor), and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) were determined in normal patients (N), in chronic pressure overload (aortic stenosis, AS), in chronic volume overload (aortic incompetence, AI), and in coronary heart disease (CHD). Peak systolic and enddiastolic wall stress were increased in AS and AI by 26-52 per cent, the systolic stress being preferably increased in AS, whereas enddiastolic stress was markedly greater in AI. Vcor and MVO2 were elevated in both groups by 45-55 per cent (p less than 0.001). Sufficient correlation was present between peak systolic wall stress and the MVO2 (r equal to 0.82). Since at a given wall stress the MVO2 was somewhat increased in AI and AS when compared with N and CHD, the considerable inhancement of the rate of pressure development (AS) was well as of the external cardiac work (AI) may contribute to the increase in overall oxygen consumption. It is concluded that systolic wall stress represents a primary determinant of MVO2 in pressure and volume overload and that the MVO2 increases in these diseases when hypertrophy becomes inappropriate with regard to the pressure and volume demands imposed to the left ventricle.},

  abstract = {Background. The global left ventricular dysfunction characteristic of left ventricular aneurysm is associated with muscle fiber stretching in the adjacent noninfarcted (border zone) region during isovolumic systole. The mechanism of this regional dysfunction is poorly understood. Methods. An anteroapical transmural myocardial infarct was created by coronary arterial ligation in an adult Dorset sheep and was allowed to mature into left ventricular aneurysm for 10 weeks. The animal was imaged subsequently using magnetic resonance imaging with simultaneous recording of intraventricular pressures. A realistic mathematical model of the three-dimensional ovine left ventricle with an anteroapical aneurysm was constructed from multiple short-axis and long-axis magnetic resonance imaging slices at the beginning of diastolic filling. Results. Three model simulations are presented: (1) normal border zone contractility and normal aneurysmal material properties; (2) greatly reduced border zone contractility (by 50\%) and normal aneurysmal material properties; and (3) greatly reduced border zone contractility (by 50\%) and stiffened aneurysmal material properties (by 1000\%). Only the latter two simulations were able to reproduce experimentally observed stretching of border zone fibers during isovolumic systole. Conclusions. The mechanism underlying mechanical dysfunction in the border zone region of left ventricular aneurysm is primarily the result of myocardial contractile dysfunction rather than increased wall stress in this region. ?? 2001 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.},

  abstract = {Background CMR feature tracking (CMR-FT) is a method of assessing strain from routinely acquired steady- state free precession (SSFP) cine images similar to echocardiographic speckle tracking. However, its application to determine myocardial twist and untwist has never previously been explored. We sought to determine the feasibility of measuring twist and untwist from routine cine images in healthy volunteers at rest and during inotropic stimulation. Methods Ten healthy volunteers had routine SSFP cine images acquired at rest and after inotropic stimulation (10 and 20 micrograms of dobutamine). The rotation of the basal and apical slices, both subendocardial and subepicardial, was measured and global LV twist \${\th}eta\$ was calculated as the difference between the counter-clockwise (positive) rotation at the apex ($\phi$apex) and clockwise rotation at the base (viewed from apex), \${\th}eta\$ = $\phi$apex- $\phi$base. Peak twist and untwist-rate and the respective times to peak were calculated using MATLAB software for both the subepicardial and subendocardial layers and compared between rest and stress. Results The peak and time to peak myocardial twist and untwist-rate are displayed at the endocardial (Table 1) and epicardial levels (Table 2). Twist and untwist-rate significantly increased with faster time to peak during dobutamine stimulation at the endocardial level (p $\backslash$textless 0.05, significance measured with a paired t-test after logarithmic transformation of the sample). These changes were paralleled by a trend towards increased twist at the epicardial level and significantly increased untwist-rate associated with faster time to peak twist and untwist-rate during dobutamine stimulation (table 2). Conclusions It is feasible to derive myocardial twist and untwist and respective times to peak, both at rest and dobutamine stress using CMR-FT. Application of these new measures of deformation by CMR-FT should next be explored in disease states.},

Recent reports on potential genotoxic effects of strong and fast switching electromagnetic gradients such as used in cardiac MR (CMR) have raised safety concerns. The aim of this study was to analyse DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human blood lymphocytes before and after CMR examination. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 20 prospectively enrolled patients, peripheral venous blood was drawn before and after 1.5 T CMR scanning. After density gradient cell separation of blood samples, DNA DSBs in lymphocytes were quantified using immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. Wilcoxon signed-rank testing was used for statistical analysis. Immunofluorescence microscopic and flow cytometric analysis revealed a significant increase in median numbers of DNA DSBs in lymphocytes induced by routine 1.5 T CMR examination. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that CMR should be used with caution and that similar restrictions may apply as for X-ray-based and nuclear imaging techniques in order to avoid unnecessary damage of DNA integrity with potential carcinogenic effect.},

  abstract = {INVITED PAPER: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an ideal imaging modality to measure blood flow and tissue motion. It provides excellent contrast between soft tissues, and images can be acquired at positions and orientations freely defined by the user. From a temporal sequence of MR images, boundaries and edges of tissues can be tracked by image processing techniques. Additionally, MRI permits the source of the image signal to be manipulated. For example, temporary magnetic tags displaying a pattern of variable brightness may be placed in the object using MR saturation techniques, giving the user a known pattern to detect for motion tracking. The MRI signal is a modulated complex quantity, being derived from a rotating magnetic field in the form of an induced current. Well-defined patterns can also be introduced into the phase of the magnetization, and could be thought of as generalized tags. If the phase of each pixel is preserved during image reconstruction, relative phase shifts can be used to directly encode displacement, velocity and acceleration. New methods for modeling motion fields from MRI have now found application in cardiovascular and other soft tissue imaging. In this review, we shall describe the methods used for encoding, imaging, and modeling motion fields with MRI.},

With exciting new bioengineering therapies for myocardial infarction on the horizon, we have reviewed the time course of structural and mechanical changes in the healing infarct in an attempt to identify key structural determinants of mechanics at several stages of healing. Based on temporal correlation, we hypothesize that normal passive material properties dominate the mechanics during acute ischemia, edema during the subsequent necrotic phase, large collagen fiber structure during the fibrotic phase, and cross-linking of collagen during the long-term remodeling phase. We hope these hypotheses will stimulate further research on infarct mechanics, particularly studies that integrate material testing, in vivo mechanics, and quantitative structural analysis.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.engfracmech.2010.04.006},
  abstract = {Anisotropic damage thermodynamics framework allows to model the concrete-like materials behavior and in particular their dissymmetric tension/compression response. To deal with dynamics applications such as impact, it is furthermore necessary to take into account the strain rate effect observed experimentally. This is done in the present work by means of anisotropic visco-damage, by introducing a material strain rate effect in the cases of positive hydrostatic stresses only. The proposed delay-damage law assumes no viscous effect in compression as the consideration of inertia effects proves sufficient to model the apparent material strength increase. High-rate dynamics applications imply to deal with wave propagation and reflection which can generate alternated loading in the impacted structure. In order to do so, the key concept of active damage is defined and introduced within both the damage criterion and the delay-damage evolution law. At the structural level, strain localization often leads to spurious mesh dependency. Three-dimensional Finite Element computations of dynamic tensile tests by spalling are presented, with visco-damage and either without or with non-local enhancement. Delay-damage, as introduced, regularizes the solution in fast dynamics. The location of the macro-crack initiated is found influenced by non-local regularization. The strain rate range in which each enhancement, delay-damage or non-local enhancement, has a regularizing effect is studied.},

  title = {Thermomechanical Behaviour of Long Fibres Ceramic-Ceramic Composites},
  volume = {66},
  abstract = {Ceramic-ceramic composites are non brittle materials in comparison with bulk ceramics, because of the interactions between the matrix and the long fibres. That is the reason why the study of the thermomechanical behaviour of such materials implies a good knowledge of these interactions, interactions which act at various scales depending on the structure of the composite. The studies reported here, brought on four composites bi- or multi-directional (cross-weave, cross-ply, 2.5D, \{[\}0, +60, -60](n)), with SiCf- or C-f long fibres, and SiC, MAS-L or C m9atrix. Under mechanical loading, these materials exhibit a more or less complex multiple cracking of the matrix, depending on the structure of the fibre reinforcement. Hence, the macroscopic mechanical behaviour of these composites is not always controlled by the friction at the fibre/matrix interfaces, but can be controlled by the friction at yarn/matrix interfaces or ply/ply interfaces. During cyclic loading, the variation of the shape of stress/strain loops with the number of cycles applied, is due to a progressive wear of these interfaces, and at high temperature under inert atmosphere the variations of the stress/strain loops are also controlled by a release of the residual thermal stresses. In addition, for materials with radial and longitudinal residual thermal stresses in tension, an apparent stiffening during cyclic fatigue has been observed, and has been attributed to a bad closure during cycling of the cracks existing in the transverse plies.},

  title = {Imaging Myocardial Fiber Disarray and Intramural Strain Hypokinesis in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy with {{MRI}}},
  volume = {23},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between myofiber disarray and myocardial hypokinesis in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) using noninvasive cardiac diffusion and strain MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five patients with a diagnosis of HCM and five age-matched healthy volunteers were studied and compared. Cardiac diffusion MRI was applied to map in vivo myocardial fiber architecture. Cardiac strain MRI was applied to map myocardial motion. By acquiring registered diffusion and strain MRI images in vivo on both normal and HCM hearts, we investigated in HCM the relationship between myofiber disarray and systolic strain components, including radial, fiber, and cross-fiber strains, and sought to determine the mechanism behind disarray-related myocardial dysfunction in HCM. RESULTS: Regionally disordered fiber orientation and reduced diffusion fractional anisotropy (FA) were found in HCM, demonstrating myofiber disarray. Intramural myocardial strain hypokinesis (reduced radial, fiber, and cross-fiber strains) was also observed in HCM in the same region, and was found to be correlated with FA. The correlation between FA and hypokinesis was found to be stronger in the cross-fiber direction (part of the passive myocardial function) compared to the fiber direction (part of the active myocardial function). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the principal feature of HCM is the reduction of myocardium passive compliance. The angle between principal shortening and fiber orientation was markedly disordered in HCM, indicating an abnormal transmural coupling. CONCLUSION: Myofiber disarray in HCM is correlated with abnormalities of both passive and active myocardial function, and the normal patterns of fiber shortening and wall thickening are deranged in HCM.},

  abstract = {Many cardiac pathologies are reflected in abnormal myocardial deformation, accessible through magnetic resonance tagging (MRT). Interpretation of the MRT data is difficult, since the relation between pathology and deformation is not straightforward. Mathematical models of cardiac mechanics could be used to translate measured abnormalities into the underlying pathology, but, so far, they even fail to correctly simulate myocardial deformation in the healthy heart. In this study we investigated to what extent (1) our previously published three-dimensional finite element model of cardiac mechanics [Kerckhoffs, R.C.P., Bovendeerd, P.H.M., Kotte, J.C.S., Prinzen, F.W., Smits, K., Arts, T., 2003. Homogeneity of cardiac contraction despite physiological asynchrony of depolarization: a model study. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 31, 536-547] can simulate measured cardiac deformation, and (2) discrepancies between strains in model and experiment are related to the choice of the myofiber orientation in the model. To this end, we measured midwall circumferential strain E(cc) and circumferential-radial shear strain E(cr) in three healthy subjects using MRT. E(cc) as computed in the model agreed well with measured E(cc). Computed E(cr) differed significantly from measured E(cr). The time course of E(cr) was found to be very sensitive to the choice of the myofiber orientation, in particular to the choice of the transverse angle. Discrepancies between circumferential-radial shear strain in model and experiment were reduced strongly by increasing the transverse angle in the original model by 25\%.},

  abstract = {Blood compatibility of a ventricular assist device (VAD) depends on the dynamics of blood flow. The focus in most previous studies was on blood flow in the VAD. However, the tip shape and position of the VAD inflow cannula influence the dynamics of intraventricular blood flow and thus thrombus formation in the ventricle. In this study, blood flow in the left ventricle (LV) under support with a catheter-type continuous flow blood pump was investigated. The flow field was analyzed both numerically and experimentally to investigate the effects of catheter tip shape and its insertion depth on intraventricular flow patterns. A computational model of the LV cavity with a simplified shape was constructed using computer-aided design software. Models of catheters with three different tip shapes were constructed and each was integrated to the LV model. In addition, three variations of insertion depth were prepared for all models. The fully supported intraventricular flow field was calculated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A transparent LV model made of silicone was also fabricated to analyze the intraventricular flow field by the particle image velocimetry technique. A mock circulation loop was constructed and water containing tracer particles was circulated in the loop. The motion of particles in the LV model was recorded with a digital high-speed video camera and analyzed to reveal the flow field. The results of numerical and experimental analyses indicated the formation of two large vortices in the bisector plane of the mitral and aortic valve planes. The shape and positioning of the catheter tip affected the flow distribution in the LV, and some of these combinations elongated the upper vortex toward the ventricular apex. Assessment based on average wall shear stress on the LV wall indicated that the flow distribution improved the washout effect. The flow patterns obtained from flow visualization coincided with those calculated by CFD analysis. Through these comparisons, the numerical analysis was validated. In conclusion, results of these numerical and experimental analyses of flow field in the LV cavity provide useful information when designing catheter-type VADs.},

  abstract = {A recent nonlocal damage formulation, in which the spatially averaged quantity was the energy dissipated due to strain-softening, is extended to a more general form in which the strain remains local while any variable that controls strain-softening is nonlocal. In contrast to the original imbricate nonlocal model for strain-softening, the stresses which figure in the constitutive relation satisfy the differential equations of equilibrium and boundary conditions of the usual classical form, and no zero-energy spurious modes of instability are encountered. However, the field operator for the present formulation is in general nonsymmetric, although not for the elastic part of response. It is shown that the energy dissipation and damage cannot localize into regions of vanishing volume. The static strain-localization instability, whose solution is reduced to an integral equation, is found to be controlled by the characteristic length of the material introduced in the averaging rule. The calculated static stability limits are close to those obtained in the previous nonlocal studies, as well as to those obtained by the crack band model in which the continuum is treated as local but the minimum size of the strain-softening region (localization region) is prescribed as a localization limiter. Furthermore, the rate of convergence of static finite-element solutions with nonlocal damage is studied and is found to be of a power type, almost quadratic. A smooth weighting function in the averaging operator is found to lead to a much better convergence than unsmooth functions},

  abstract = {To examine transmural finite deformation in the wall of the canine left ventricle, closely spaced columns of lead beads were implanted at a single site on the left ventricular free wall. The three-dimensional coordinates of these myocardial markers were obtained with high-speed biplane cineradiography. Any four noncoplanar markers forming small tetrahedral volumes (less than or equal to 0.1 cc) were used to calculate finite normal and shear strains with respect to a cardiac coordinate system at end diastole. Due to the symmetry of the finite strain tensor, the algebraic eigenvalue problem could be solved to compute principal strains and the directions of the principal axes of deformation with respect to the reference coordinates. An examination of the principal strains in a number of tetrahedra in five animals indicates that deformation increases with depth beneath the epicardium. For example, the transmural variation of principal shortening strain averages -0.014 +/- 0.009 per 10\% increment in thickness from epicardium to endocardium. Furthermore, shortening and thickening strains at midwall and deeper are too large (0.10 to 0.40) to be described accurately by infinitesimal theory. These strains are often accompanied by substantial in-plane and transverse shears which are not predicted by typical membrane or shell theories, indicating that these theories must be applied with caution when computing indices of regional ventricular performance. The directions of the principal axes of shortening vary substantially less than the fiber direction varies across the wall (20 degrees - 40 degrees compared with 100 degrees - 140 degrees for fiber direction), supporting the concept that there are substantial interactions between neighboring fibers in the left ventricular wall.},

The model is shown to accurately reproduce the usual sharp interface conditions in the limit of a thin diffuse interface region. A first test of the model is provided for flow through regular arrays of cylinders with a stationary interface. Then, two examples are presented that involve solid/liquid phase-change: (i) coarsening of a mush of a binary alloy, where both the interface curvature and the flow permeability evolve with time, and (ii) dendritic growth in the presence of melt convection with particular emphasis on the operating point of the tip. 1999},

  abstract = {Perspectives are presented on ceramics and ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) as high-temperature materials. The emphasis is on design and life prediction requirements and their role in directing research. Important themes include the relative roles of fracture toughness and inelastic strain (ductility), as well as scaling and stochastic effects caused by manufacturing defects. Ceramics with high toughness have been developed. However, because they are inductile, design with such materials is based on elastic stresses, combined with weakest link scaling and extreme value statistics. Procedures that ensure reliable performance under these circumstances are inherently constrained. Opportunities to mitigate these restrictions by matching mechanisms to design are explored. By contrast CMCs exhibit inelastic strain mechanisms that provide an efficient means of redistributing stress. These mechanisms eliminate stress concentrations and suppress scaling effects, enabling design procedures similar to those used with metals. The sources and mechanisms of inelastic strain are described, as well as the ensuing constitutive models. Examples of their finite element implementation in design are presented. A life prediction methodology requires a robust procedure for characterizing fatigue effects in conjunction with manufacturing and machining flaws. A lifing approach is described having commonality between ceramics and CMCs.},

This effect has been designated as a nuisance by a few authors. The lifetime of SiC (Nicalon) multifilament tows is investigated in static fatigue in air at temperatures in the range of 600degrees-700degreesC. The various features that have been identified suggest that delayed failure under low stresses results from a slow-crack-growth mechanism. Analysis of acoustic emission data allows the number of failures during the tests to be determined. Scanning electron microscopy examination of tow fracture surfaces allows typical crack patterns to be identified. A model of delayed failure is proposed. The model is based on the Paris law and on the well-known model of subcritical crack growth devised by Davidge et al. for ceramics. The model takes into account the statistics of fiber failure. The slow-crack-growth constants have been determined from stress-rupture data. Finally, the model allows satisfactory description of the lifetime of tows and prediction of the lifetime of Nicalon/SiC minicomposites.},

Second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy is a valuable imaging technique to probe collagen fibrillar organization.

Our theoretical expectations are confirmed by experimental results in rat-tail tendon. To that end, we report what to our knowledge is the first experimental implementation of polarization-resolved SHG microscopy combined with mechanical assays, to simultaneously monitor the biomechanical response of rat-tail tendon at macroscopic scale and the rearrangement of collagen fibrils in this tissue at microscopic scale. These experiments bring direct evidence that tendon stretching corresponds to straightening and aligning of collagen fibrils within the fascicle. We observe a decrease in the SHG anisotropy parameter when the tendon is stretched in a physiological range, in agreement with our numerical simulations. Moreover, these experiments provide a unique measurement of the nonlinear optical response of aligned fibrils. Our data show an excellent agreement with recently published theoretical calculations of the collagen triple helix hyperpolarizability.},

Our model suggests that when the contractility increases sufficiently far beyond the motility initiation threshold, the cell can stop and re-symmetrizes.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endoventricular patch plasty (Dor) is used to reduce left ventricular volume after myocardial infarction and subsequent left ventricular remodeling. METHODS AND RESULTS: End-diastolic and end-systolic pressure-volume and Starling relationships were measured, and magnetic resonance images with noninvasive tags were used to calculate 3-dimensional myocardial strain in 6 sheep 2 weeks before and 2 and 6 weeks after the Dor procedure. These experimental results were previously reported. The imaging data from 1 sheep were incomplete. Animal specific finite element models were created from the remaining 5 animals using magnetic resonance images and left ventricular pressure obtained at early diastolic filling. Finite element models were optimized with 3-dimensional strain and used to determine systolic material properties, T(max,skinned-fiber), and diastolic and systolic stress in remote myocardium and border zone. Six weeks after the Dor procedure, end-diastolic and end-systolic stress in the border zone were substantially reduced. However, although there was a slight increase in T(max,skinned-fiber) in the border zone near the myocardial infarction at 6 weeks, the change was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The Dor procedure decreases end-diastolic and end-systolic stress but fails to improve contractility in the infarct border zone. Future work should focus on measures that will enhance border zone function alone or in combination with surgical remodeling.},

Methods and Results\textendash{}In dogs, a large coronary artery was occluded to study AI and/or chronic infarction (n=18), and a second coronary artery was chronically instrumented with a reversible hydraulic occluder and Doppler flowmeter to study RII (n=8). At 3 days after surgery, cine MRI revealed reduced wall thickening in AI (5\{+/-\}6\% versus 33\{+/-\}6\% in normal, P$\backslash$textless0.001). In RII, wall thickening before, during, and after inflation of the occluder for 15 minutes was 35\{+/-\}5\%, 1\{+/-\}8\%, and 21\{+/-\}10\% and Doppler flow was 19.8\{+/-\}5.3, 0.2\{+/-\}0.5, and 56.3\{+/-\}17.7 (peak hyperemia) cm/s, respectively, confirming occlusion, transient ischemia, and reperfusion. Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR images acquired 30 minutes after contrast revealed hyperenhancement of AI (294\{+/-\}96\% of normal, P$\backslash$textless0.001) but not of RII (98\{+/-\}6\% of normal, P=NS). Eight weeks later, the chronically infarcted region again hyperenhanced (253\{+/-\}54\% of normal, n=8, P$\backslash$textless0.001). High-resolution (0.5x0.5x0.5 mm) ex vivo MRI demonstrated that the spatial extent of hyperenhancement was the same as the spatial extent of myocyte necrosis with and without reperfusion at 1 day (R=0.99, P$\backslash$textless0.001) and 3 days (R=0.99, P$\backslash$textless0.001) and collagenous scar at 8 weeks (R=0.97, P$\backslash$textless0.001). Conclusions\textendash{}In the pathophysiologies investigated, contrast MRI distinguishes between reversible and irreversible ischemic injury independent of wall motion and infarct age.},

  doi = {10.1023/A:1010835316564},
  abstract = {In this paper we develop a new constitutive law for the description of the (passive) mechanical response of arterial tissue. The artery is modeled as a thick-walled nonlinearly elastic circular cylindrical tube consisting of two layers corresponding to the media and adventitia (the solid mechanically relevant layers in healthy tissue). Each layer is treated as a fiber-reinforced material with the fibers corresponding to the collagenous component of the material and symmetrically disposed with respect to the cylinder axis. The resulting constitutive law is orthotropic in each layer. Fiber orientations obtained from a statistical analysis of histological sections from each arterial layer are used. A specific form of the law, which requires only three material parameters for each layer, is used to study the response of an artery under combined axial extension, inflation and torsion. The characteristic and very important residual stress in an artery in vitro is accounted for by assuming that the natural (unstressed and unstrained) configuration of the material corresponds to an open sector of a tube, which is then closed by an initial bending to form a load-free, but stressed, circular cylindrical configuration prior to application of the extension, inflation and torsion. The effect of residual stress on the stress distribution through the deformed arterial wall in the physiological state is examined. The model is fitted to available data on arteries and its predictions are assessed for the considered combined loadings. It is explained how the new model is designed to avoid certain mechanical, mathematical and computational deficiencies evident in currently available phenomenological models. A critical review of these models is provided by way of background to the development of the new model.},

In this study, numerical simulations of blood flow in a patient-specific anatomical model of the left ventricle (LV) and the aortic sinus are presented. The realistic 3D geometry of both LV and aortic sinus is extracted from the processing of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, motion of inner walls of LV and aortic sinus is obtained from cine-MR image analysis and is used as a constraint to a numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on the moving boundary approach. Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element method formulation is used for the numerical solution of the transient dynamic equations of the fluid domain. Simulation results include detailed flow characteristics such as velocity, pressure and wall shear stress for the whole domain. The aortic outflow is compared with data obtained by phase-contrast MRI. Good agreement was found between simulation results and these measurements.},

  abstract = {Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is an effective treatment for patients with congestive heart failure and a wide QRS complex. However, up to 30\% of patients are non-responders to therapy in terms of exercise capacity or left ventricular reverse remodelling. A number of controversies still remain surrounding patient selection, targeted lead implantation and optimisation of this important treatment. The development of biophysical models to predict the response to CRT represents a potential strategy to address these issues. In this article, we present how the personalisation of an electromechanical model of the myocardium can predict the acute haemodynamic changes associated with CRT. In order to introduce such an approach as a clinical application, we needed to design models that can be individualised from images and electrophysiological mapping of the left ventricle. In this paper the personalisation of the anatomy, the electrophysiology, the kinematics and the mechanics are described. The acute effects of pacing on pressure development were predicted with the in silico model for several pacing conditions on two patients, achieving good agreement with invasive haemodynamic measurements: the mean error on dP/dt(max) is 47.5$\pm$35mmHgs(-1), less than 5\% error. These promising results demonstrate the potential of physiological models personalised from images and electrophysiology signals to improve patient selection and plan CRT.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.10.008},
  abstract = {This paper presents a modelling framework in which the mechanochemical properties of smooth muscle cells may be studied. The activation of smooth muscles is considered in a three-dimensional continuum model which is key to realistically capture the function of hollow organs such as blood vessels. On the basis of a general thermodynamical framework the mechanical and chemical phases are specialized in order to quantify the coupled mechanochemical process. A free-energy function is proposed as the sum of a mechanical energy stored in the passive tissue, a coupling between the mechanical and chemical kinetics and an energy related purely to the chemical kinetics and the calcium ion concentration. For the chemical phase it is shown that the cross-bridge model of Hai and Murphy [1988. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 254, C99-C106] is included in the developed evolution law as a special case. In order to show the specific features and the potential of the proposed continuum model a uniaxial extension test of a tissue strip is analysed in detail and the related kinematics and stress-stretch relations are derived. Parameter studies point to coupling phenomena; in particular the tissue response is analysed in terms of the calcium ion level. The model for smooth muscle contraction may significantly contribute to current modelling efforts of smooth muscle tissue responses.},

  title = {Cardiac Diffusion {{MRI}} without Motion Effects},
  volume = {48},
  abstract = {We present a method for diffusion tensor MRI in the beating heart that is insensitive to cardiac motion and strain. Using a stimulated echo pulse sequence with two electrocardiogram (ECG) triggers, diffusion-encoding bipolar gradient pulses are applied at identical phases in consecutive cardiac cycles. In this experiment, diffusion is encoded at a single phase in the cardiac cycle of less than 30 ms in duration. This encoding produces no phase shifts for periodic motion and is independent of intervening strains. Studies in a gel phantom with cyclic deformation confirm that by using this sequence we can map the diffusion tensor free of effects of cyclic motion. In normal human subjects, myocardial diffusion eigenvalues measured with the present method showed no significant change between acquisitions encoded at maximum contractile velocity (peak) vs. at myocardial standstill (end-systole), demonstrating motion independence of in vivo diffusion measurements. Diffusion tensor images acquired with the present method agree with registered data acquired with a previous cardiac diffusion MRI method that was shown to be valid in the normal heart, strongly supporting the validity of MRI diffusion measurement in the beating heart. Myocardial sheet and fiber dynamics measured during systole showed that normal human myocardial sheet orientations tilt toward the radial during systole, and fiber orientations tilt toward the longitudinal, in qualitative agreement with previous invasive studies in canines. These results demonstrate the technique's ability to measure myocardial diffusion accurately at any point in the cardiac cycle free of measurable motion effect, as if the heart were frozen at the point of acquisition.},

  volume = {27},
  issn = {0022-2828},
  abstract = {Studies of hemodynamics and intrinsic left ventricular myocardial function are carried out to investigate the transition from stable hypertrophy to cardiac decompensation in the aging (18-24 months) spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Echocardiographic data in awake animals demonstrate increased end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and depressed ejection fractions in left ventricles from SHR with failure (SHR-F) as compared to age matched hypertensive (SHR-NF) and non-hypertensive control animals (WKY). Cardiac catheterization data in anesthetized animals demonstrate depression of both systolic pressure and +dP/dt, and elevated end-diastolic pressure in the SHR-F relative to the two control groups. Since loading conditions and altered demand states may contribute to altered ventricular function, studies of isolated perfused hearts were carried out which demonstrate impaired systolic stress development in the SHR-F group under conditions in which loading conditions are controlled; in addition, it is observed that increasing perfusion pressure by 30 mm Hg has little effect on function. Depression of systolic function and increases in passive stiffness of isolated muscle preparations from the SHR-F indicate impairment of systolic and diastolic function at the tissue level. While all of the preparations studied have potential shortcomings, an integration of findings from these complementary approaches supports the conclusion that heart failure develops in the aging SHR. Furthermore, these data suggest that impaired function is due to changes in the intrinsic properties of the myocardium and that the connective tissue response may play an important role. These studies, in conjunction with the findings of others who have studied the aging SHR, provide support for the use of the aging SHR as a model of the transition from compensated hypertrophy to failure.},

  abstract = {Myocardial tissue tagging using complementary spatial modulation of magnetization (CSPAMM) allows detailed assessment of myocardial motion. To capture the complex 3D cardiac motion pattern, multiple 2D tagged slices are usually acquired in different orientations. These approaches are prone to slice misregistration and associated with long acquisition times. In this work, a fast method for acquiring 3D CSPAMM data is proposed that allows measuring deformation of the whole heart in three breath-holds of 18 heartbeats duration each. Three acquisitions are sequentially performed with line tag preparation in each orthogonal direction. Measurement acceleration is achieved by applying localized tagging preparation and a hybrid multishot, segmented echo-planar imaging sequence. Five healthy volunteers and five patients with myocardial infarction were measured. Midwall contours were tracked throughout the cardiac cycle with an enhanced variant of the harmonic phase (HARP) technique. Circumferential shortening at end-systole ranged from 14.1\% (base) to 20.1\% (apex) in healthy subjects. Hypokinetic regions in patients corresponded well with regions exhibiting hyperenhancement after contrast injection. Time to maximum circumferential shortening varied more significantly over the left ventricle in patients than in volunteers (P$\backslash$textless0.01). The proposed measurement scheme was well tolerated by patients and holds considerable potential to investigate cardiac mechanics in various diseases.},

Responsibility for administering the Animal Welfare Act was delegated within the United States Department of Agriculture to the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and regulations and standards have been developed to implement the intent of Congress conveyed in the language of the Act. In our opinion, the key to compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and its regulations and standards is to have in place a proactive, progressive Animal Care and Use Program that uses the semiannual inspection and programmatic review process to improve the day-to-day management of the program. Successfully managing the inspection process has taken on new meaning in what has recently become known as the 'Age of Enforcement.' As part of this approach, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service made changes to the inspection process and issued an Enhanced Animal Welfare Enforcement Plan, which included the development of an Inspection Requirements Handbook. The Inspection Requirements Handbook provides inspectors with information on conducting inspections and includes as an attachment a flow chart for Enforcement Action Guidance. The chart describes 4 types of actions that may occur as part of the enforcement process and the steps that will be followed if noncompliant items are documented during an inspection.},

We validated our results by delayed-enhancement cardiac MRI (DE-MRI). Methods and Results\textendash{} We prospectively studied 15 ambulatory patients with stable coronary disease who were candidates for cardiac catheterization. Within 48 hours of EMM, DE-MRI was performed. Using EMM software, we created a bull's eye precisely matched to that generated by DE-MRI. Segment by segment, we compared the MRI results to the corresponding unipolar voltage value for that same segment in the EMM bull's eye. Of 300 total segments, 275 were compared. The segments were divided into normal (n=211), subendocardial scar (n=49), and transmural scar (n=15). We found that subendocardial (6.8\{+/-\}2.9 mV) and transmural (4.6\{+/-\}1.9 mV) scar segments had significantly less unipolar voltage than normal (11.6\{+/-\}4.5 mV) segments (P$\backslash$textless0.05 for each comparison). When normal myocardium was compared with myocardium with subendocardial scar, the threshold for differentiating between the two areas was 7.9 mV (sensitivity, 80\%; specificity, 80\%). Comparison of normal tissue to transmural scar yielded a threshold of 6.9 mV (sensitivity, 93\%; specificity, 88\%). Conclusions\textendash{} Our results demonstrate that normal myocardium can be accurately distinguished from myocardium with subendocardial or transmural infarcts on the basis of unipolar voltage values obtained through EMM. This is the first study to validate these results by using cardiac DE-MRI in humans.},

However the capacity for self-regeneration of the adult heart is very limited and the loss of cardiomyocytes in the infarcted heart leads to continuous adverse cardiac-remodeling which often leads to heart-failure (HF). The concept of regenerative medicine comprising cell-based therapies, bio-engineering technologies and hybrid solutions has been proposed as a promising next-generation approach to address IHD and HF. Numerous strategies are under investigation evaluating the potential of regenerative medicine on the failing myocardium including classical cell-therapy concepts, three-dimensional culture techniques and tissue-engineering approaches. While most of these regenerative strategies have shown great potential in experimental studies, the translation into a clinical setting has either been limited or too rapid leaving many key questions unanswered. This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art, important challenges and future research directions as to regenerative approaches addressing IHD and resulting HF.},

Cross-fiber anisotropy is also observed. In the beating heart, NMR diffusion data must be corrected for the effects of myocardial deformation during the cardiac cycle. This correction can be performed using an independent MRI method to map the strain-rate tensor field of the myocardium through time. Combining fiber orientation with local myocardial strain rate, local rates of myocardial fiber shortening may be computed.},

  doi = {10.1186/1532-429X-13-36},
  abstract = {Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) tagging has been established as an essential technique for measuring regional myocardial function. It allows quantification of local intramyocardial motion measures, e.g. strain and strain rate. The invention of CMR tagging came in the late eighties, where the technique allowed for the first time for visualizing transmural myocardial movement without having to implant physical markers. This new idea opened the door for a series of developments and improvements that continue up to the present time. Different tagging techniques are currently available that are more extensive, improved, and sophisticated than they were twenty years ago. Each of these techniques has different versions for improved resolution, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), scan time, anatomical coverage, three-dimensional capability, and image quality. The tagging techniques covered in this article can be broadly divided into two main categories: 1) Basic techniques, which include magnetization saturation, spatial modulation of magnetization (SPAMM), delay alternating with nutations for tailored excitation (DANTE), and complementary SPAMM (CSPAMM); and 2) Advanced techniques, which include harmonic phase (HARP), displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE), and strain encoding (SENC). Although most of these techniques were developed by separate groups and evolved from different backgrounds, they are in fact closely related to each other, and they can be interpreted from more than one perspective. Some of these techniques even followed parallel paths of developments, as illustrated in the article. As each technique has its own advantages, some efforts have been made to combine different techniques together for improved image quality or composite information acquisition. In this review, different developments in pulse sequences and related image processing techniques are described along with the necessities that led to their invention, which makes this article easy to read and the covered techniques easy to follow. Major studies that applied CMR tagging for studying myocardial mechanics are also summarized. Finally, the current article includes a plethora of ideas and techniques with over 300 references that motivate the reader to think about the future of CMR tagging.},

  abstract = {A series of models were developed in which a circulatory system model was coupled to an existing series of finite element (FE) models of the left ventricle (LV). The circulatory models were used to provide realistic boundary conditions for the LV models. This was developed for the JSim analysis package and was composed of a systemic arterial, capillary, and venous system in a closed loop with a varying elastance LV and left atria to provide the driving pressures and flows matching those of the FE model. Three coupled models were developed, a normal LV under normotensive aortic loading (116/80 mm Hg), a mild hypertension (137/89 mm Hg) model, and a moderate hypertension model (165/100 mm Hg). The initial step in the modeling analysis was that the circulation was optimized to the end-diastolic pressure and volume values of the LV model. The cardiac FE models were then optimized to the systolic pressure/volume characteristics of the steady-state JSim circulatory model solution. Comparison of the stress predictions for the three models indicated that the mild hypertensive case produced a 21\% increase in the average fiber stress levels, and the moderate hypertension case had a 36\% increase in average stress. The circulatory work increased by 18\% and 43\% over that of the control for the mild and moderate hypertensive cases, respectively.},

  abstract = {Background: Undersized mitral annuloplasty (MA) is the preferred surgical treatment for chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation. However, the preferred shape of undersized MA is unclear. Methods: A previously described finite element model of the left ventricle with mitral valve based on magnetic resonance images of a sheep with chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation after posterolateral myocardial infarction was used. Saddle-shape (Edwards Physio II) and asymmetric (IMR ETlogix) MA rings were digitized and meshed. Virtual annuloplasty was performed using virtual sutures to attach the MA ring. Left ventricular diastole and systole were performed before and after virtual MA of each type. Results: Both types of MA reduced the septolateral dimension of the mitral annulus and abolished mitral regurgitation. The asymmetric MA was associated with lower virtual suture force in the P2 region but higher force in P1 and P3 regions. Although both types of MA reduced fiber stress at the left ventricular base, fiber stress reduction after asymmetric MA was slightly greater. Neither type of MA affected fiber stress at the left ventricular equator or apex. Although both types of MA increased leaflet curvature and reduced leaflet stress, stress reduction with saddle-shape MA was slightly greater. Both MA types reduced stress on the mitral chordae. Conclusions: The effects of saddle-shape and asymmetric MA rings are similar. Finite element simulations are a powerful tool that may reduce the need for animal and clinical trials. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the distribution and regional differences of flow and vessel wall parameters such as wall shear stress (WSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI) in the entire thoracic aorta. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one healthy volunteers (mean age = 23.7 +/- 3.3 years) were examined by flow-sensitive four-dimensional (4D)-MRI at 3T. For eight retrospectively positioned 2D analysis planes distributed along the thoracic aorta, flow parameters and vectorial WSS and OSI were assessed in 12 segments along the vascular circumference. RESULTS: Mean absolute time-averaged WSS ranged between 0.25 +/- 0.04 N/m(2) and 0.33 +/- 0.07 N/m(2) and incorporated a substantial circumferential component (-0.05 +/- 0.04 to 0.07 +/- 0.02 N/m(2)). For each analysis plane, a segment with lowest absolute WSS and highest OSI was identified which differed significantly from mean values within the plane (P $\backslash$textless 0.05). The distribution of atherogenic low WSS and high OSI closely resembled typical locations of atherosclerotic lesions at the inner aortic curvature and supraaortic branches. CONCLUSION: The normal distribution of vectorial WSS and OSI in the entire thoracic aorta derived from flow-sensitive 4D-MRI data provides a reference constituting an important perquisite for the examination of patients with aortic disease. Marked regional differences in absolute WSS and OSI may help explaining why atherosclerotic lesions predominantly develop and progress at specific locations in the aorta.},

Methods are presented for determining physically and computationally unstable crack configurations for various forms of p(u), including functions possessing a peak.

  abstract = {Continuum Damage Mechanics offers a simple and attractive framework for describing the progressive deterioration of materials before macrocrack initiation and fracture. A better modelling of actual damaging processes in initially isotropic materials like metals and concrete needs to take into account two factors: The anisotropic nature of the damage, which is related to the direction of the past loading history; The unilateral character of damage, corresponding to the possible closure of defects under compressive loading conditions. In this paper, this discussion is limited to the case of the elastic behaviour of rate independent damaging materials like concrete. A new unilateral damage condition is formulated, which allows the description of active/passive damage effect with anisotropic damage, using either second or fourth order tensors for the damage state variables. Moreover, a simple but general form of the damage rate equation is proposed, which has the potential of describing fairly well the development of the anisotropic damage using a fourth order damage tensor.},

Living structures can grow stronger, weaker, larger, or smaller within months, weeks, or days as a result of a continuous microstructural turnover and renewal. Hard tissues can adapt by increasing their density and grow strong. Soft tissues can adapt by increasing their volume and grow large. For more than three decades, the mechanics community has actively contributed to understand the phenomena of growth and remodeling from a mechanistic point of view. However, to date, there is no single, unified characterization of growth, which is equally accepted by all scientists in the field. Here we shed light on the continuum modeling of growth and remodeling of living matter, and give a comprehensive overview of historical developments and trends. We provide a state-of-the-art review of current research highlights, and discuss challenges and potential future directions. Using the example of volumetric growth, we illustrate how we can establish and utilize growth theories to characterize the functional adaptation of soft living matter. We anticipate this review to be the starting point for critical discussions and future research in growth and remodeling, with a potential impact on life science and medicine. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is constructed in such a way that it reproduces exactly the behavior of a ``composite-sphere assemblage'' in the limit of hydrostatic loadings, and therefore coincides with the hydrostatic limit of Gurson's criterion in the special case of ideal plasticity. As a consequence, the new model improves on earlier homogenization estimates, which have been found to be quite accurate for low triaxialities but overly stiff for sufficiently high triaxialities and nonlinearities. Additionally, the estimates delivered by the model exhibit a dependence on the third invariant of the macroscopic stress tensor, which has a nontrivial effect on the effective response of the material at moderate triaxialities. The proposed model is compared with exact results obtained for a special class of porous materials with sequentially laminated microstructures. The agreement is found to be quite good for the entire range of stress triaxialities, and all values of the porosity and nonlinearity considered.},

The method was applied to data obtained in four healthy volunteers, and data were pooled according to position within the model. Analytic modeling demonstrated that the calculated strain field was relatively invariant to the type of smoothing constraint applied; the greatest error was in the circumferential-radial shear strain. Displacement, torsion, and strain extracted from the model agreed with previous results of two-dimensional MR imaging analyses and 3D studies involving the implantation of radiopaque beads in canine myocardium. The model-driven approach provides an accurate and flexible technique for noninvasive estimation of 3D in vivo deformation of the human heart.},

  abstract = {The structural protein elastin endows large arteries with unique biological functionality and mechanical integrity, hence its disorganization, fragmentation, or degradation can have important consequences on the progression and treatment of vascular diseases. There is, therefore, a need in arterial mechanics to move from materially uniform, phenomenological, constitutive relations for the wall to those that account for separate contributions of the primary structural constituents: elastin, fibrillar collagens, smooth muscle, and amorphous matrix. In this paper, we employ a recently proposed constrained mixture model of the arterial wall and show that prestretched elastin contributes significantly to both the retraction of arteries that is observed upon transection and the opening angle that follows the introduction of a radial cut in an unloaded segment. We also show that the transmural distributions of elastin and collagen, compressive stiffness of collagen, and smooth muscle tone play complementary roles. Axial prestresses and residual stresses in arteries contribute to the homeostatic state of stress in vivo as well as adaptations to perturbed loads, disease, or injury. Understanding better the development of and changes in wall stress due to individual extracellular matrix constituents thus promises to provide considerable clinically important insight into arterial health and disease.},

The method uses isolated spectral peaks in SPAMM-tagged magnetic resonance images, which contain information about cardiac motion. The inverse Fourier transform of a spectral peak is a complex image whose calculated angle is called a harmonic phase (HARP) image. It is shown how two HARP image sequences can be used to automatically and accurately track material points through time. A rapid, semiautomated procedure to calculate circumferential and radial Lagrangian strain from tracked points is described. This new computational approach permits rapid analysis and visualization of myocardial strain within 5-10 min after the scan is complete. Its performance is demonstrated on MR image sequences reflecting both normal and abnormal cardiac motion. Results from the new method are shown to compare very well with a previously validated tracking algorithm. Magn Reson Med 42:1048-1060, 1999.},

It is demonstrated in this study that the substitution of more RF pulses, with their relative amplitudes distributed according to the binomial sequence, results in sharper stripes. This permits the use of a two-dimensional grid of stripes for more detailed studies of heart wall motion and provides a unique method of analyzing regional ventricular myocardial strain.},

  abstract = {Large coil arrays are widely used in clinical routine for cardiovascular imaging providing extended spatial coverage and enabling accelerated acquisition using parallel imaging approaches. This work investigates the use of large coil arrays in single-voxel cardiac spectroscopy for the detection of myocardial creatine and triglyceride content. For this purpose, a navigator-gated and cardiac-triggered point-resolved spectroscopy sequence was implemented, and data obtained in 11 healthy volunteers using 32- and 5-element coil arrays were compared. For combination of the individual coil element signals, four strategies were evaluated differing in the manner of estimation of the complex coil weights and the amount of additional information required for coil combination. In all volunteers, and with both the 32- and 5-channel coil arrays, triglyceride-to-water (0.44 $\pm$ 0.19\% and 0.45 $\pm$ 0.17\%) and total creatine-to-water (0.05 $\pm$ 0.02\% and 0.05 $\pm$ 0.01\%) contents were computed. The values were found to agree well, showing an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.76 (p $\backslash$textless 0.003). The results revealed a gain in signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 24\% with the 32-channel coil relative to the 5-channel array. The findings may foster the integration of cardiac spectroscopy into clinical practice using large coil arrays, provided that appropriate reconstruction algorithms are implemented.},

However, the mechanical properties of these valves are insufficient for implantation at the aortic position. To simulate the effect of collagen remodeling on the mechanical properties of the aortic valve, a finite element model is presented. In this study collagen remodeling is assumed to be the net result of collagen synthesis and degradation. A limited number of fibers with low initial fiber volume fraction is defined, and depending on the loading condition, the fibers are either synthesized or degraded. The synthesis and degradation of collagen fibers are both assumed to be functions of individual fiber stretch and fiber volume fraction. Simulations are performed for closed aortic valve configurations and the open aortic valve configuration. The predicted fiber directions for the closed configurations are close to the fiber directions as measured in the native aortic valve. The model predicts the evolution in collagen fiber content and the effect of remodeling on the mechanical properties. (C) 2003 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

The physical and geometrical parameters governing the initiation, accumulation, growth and saturation of matrix cracks under cyclic mechanical loading have been identified. A shear-lag analysis, associated with an energy release rate criterion, is used to predict cracking development in each cross-ply laminate subjected to any fatigue loading. More recently, an experimental program has been achieved to characterize the damage development due to thermal cyclic loading. This investigation brought out the limitations of a purely mechanical approach for the prediction of matrix cracking due to cyclic thermal exposure.},

  abstract = {Aims Dynamic three-dimensional-cardiac magnetic resonance (3D-CMR) perfusion proved highly diagnostic for the detection of angiographically defined coronary artery disease (CAD) and has been used to assess the efficacy of coronary stenting procedures. The present study aimed to relate significant coronary lesions as assessed by fractional flow reserve (FFR) to the volume of myocardial hypoenhancement on 3D-CMR adenosine stress perfusion imaging and to define the inter-study reproducibility of stress inducible 3D-CMR hypoperfusion. Methods A total of 120 patients with known or suspected CAD were examined in two CMR centres using 1.5 T systems. The and results protocol included cine imaging, 3D-CMR perfusion during adenosine infusion, and at rest followed by delayed enhancement (DE) imaging. Fractional flow reserve was recorded in epicardial coronary arteries and side branches with $\backslash$textgreater2 mm luminal diameter and $\backslash$textgreater40\% severity stenosis (pathologic FFR $\backslash$textless 0.75). Twenty-five patients underwent an identical repeat CMR examination for the determination of inter-study reproducibility of 3D-CMR perfusion deficits induced by adenosine. Three-dimensional CMR perfusion scans were visually classified as pathologic if one or more segments showed an inducible perfusion deficit in the absence of DE. Myocardial ischaemic burden (MIB) was measured by segmentation of the area of inducible hypoenhancement and normalized to left ventricular myocardial volume (MIB, \%). Three-dimensional CMR perfusion resulted in a sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of 90, 82, and 87\%, respectively. Substantial concordance was found for inter-study reproducibility [Lin's correlation coefficient: 0.98 (95\% confidence interval: 0.96-0.99)]. Conclusion Three-dimensional CMR stress perfusion provided high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of functionally significant CAD. Myocardial ischaemic burden measurements were highly reproducible and allowed the assessment of CAD severity.},

The original feature of this model is that it combines different types of variables in describing the damage state of the material. It is now admitted that defects, depending on their reinforcement/matrix properties, can be oriented either by the microstructure, and can then be expressed by a family of scalar variables, or by the loading, in which case tensorial variables must be used. This new model can be used to describe all the essential phenomena observed in composites, namely: initial anisotropy; induced anisotropy, i.e. the effects of the damage on the elastic properties; defaults evolution laws; and closure effects in relation with residual strains. After presenting the general framework of the model, we propose a particular application to the case of ceramic matrix composites.},

  abstract = {The mechanics of the ischemic left ventricle during a complete cardiac cycle were simulated using a finite-element model accounting for the thick-walled ventricular geometry, the fibrous nature of the myocardial tissue, and the dependency of active muscle fiber stress on time, strain, and strain rate. Ischemia was modeled by disabling the generation of active stress in a region comprising approximately 12\% of total wall volume. In the model simulations, the approximately 12\% reduction in the amount of normally contracting tissue resulted in an approximately 25\% reduction in stroke work compared with the normal situation. The more-than-proportional loss of stroke work may partly be attributed to storage of elastic energy in the bulging ischemic region. Furthermore the mechanical performance in the nonischemic border zone deteriorated because of reduced systolic fiber stress (if fibers were in series with those in the ischemic region) or reduced fiber shortening (if fibers were parallel). The deformation pattern of the ventricle was asymmetric with respect to the ischemic region because of the anisotropy of the myocardial tissue. Epicardial fiber shortening in and around the ischemic region, as predicted from the model simulations, was in qualitative agreement with shortening, as measured in four dogs in which ischemia was induced by occlusion of the distal part of the left anterior interventricular coronary artery.},

  abstract = {The objective of this research was to assess applicability of a technique known as hyperelastic warping for the measurement of local strains in the left ventricle (LV) directly from microPET image data sets. The technique uses differences in image intensities between template (reference) and target (loaded) image data sets to generate a body force that deforms a finite element (FE) representation of the template so that it registers with the target images. For validation, the template image was defined as the end-systolic microPET image data set from a Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat. The target image was created by mapping the template image using the deformation results obtained from a FE model of diastolic filling. Regression analysis revealed highly significant correlations between the simulated forward FE solution and image derived warping predictions for fiber stretch (R (2) = 0.96), circumferential strain (R (2) = 0.96), radial strain (R (2) = 0.93), and longitudinal strain (R (2) = 0.76) (p $\backslash$textless 0.001 for all cases). The technology was applied to microPET image data of two spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and a WKY control. Regional analysis revealed that, the lateral freewall in the SHR subjects showed the greatest deformation compared with the other wall segments. This work indicates that warping can accurately predict the strain distributions during diastole from the analysis of microPET data sets.},

  abstract = {Recent research suggests that left ventricular torsion is an important indicator of cardiac function. We used two theoretical models to study the mechanics of this phenomenon: a compressible cylinder and an incompressible ellipsoid of revolution. The analyses of both models account for large- strain passive and active material behavior, with a muscle fiber angle that varies linearly from endocardium to epicardium. Relative to the end- diastolic configuration, the predicted torsion exhibits several experimentally observed features, including a peak near end systole, rapid untwisting during isovolumic relaxation, and increased twist near the apex. The magnitude of the twist is sensitive to the fiber architecture, the ventricular geometry, and the compressibility and contractility of the myocardium. In particular, the model predicts that the systolic twist increases with increasing compressibility, contractility, and wall thickness, while it decreases with increasing cavity volume. The peak twist approximately doubles (from about 0.02 to 0.04 rad cm(-1)) with a doubling of myocardial compressibility or with a change in the endocardial/epicardial muscle fiber angles from 90/-90 degrees to 60/-60 degrees. The twist is less sensitive to changes in contractility and ventricular geometry. These findings provide a basis for interpreting measurements of ventricular torsion in the clinical setting.

The overall philosophy recognizes the need for models that allow efficient interpolation between experimental results, as the constituents and the fibre architecture are varied. This approach is necessary because empirical methods are prohibitively expensive. Moreover, the field is not yet mature, though evolving rapidly. Consequently, an attempt is made to provide a framework into which models could be inserted, and then validated by means of an efficient experimental matrix. The most comprehensive available models and the status of experimental assessments are reviewed. The phenomena given emphasis include: the stress/strain behaviour in tension and shear, the ultimate tensile strength and notch sensitivity, fatigue, stress corrosion and creep.},

In particular, we compare the relative influence of surface tension, osmotic pressure and the pore size and radius of curvature on the densification of the green bodies. Variations of the osmotic pressure when changing the solvent can yield significantly different behaviour during the freezing stage and therefore significantly affect the densification behaviour, an effect not apparent when using the Shanti model. In addition, and equally important, a modification of the macropores morphology is induced by the evolution of the solvent crystals morphology, and resulting in smaller and more intricate crystals and macropores which facilitates the densification. The radius of curvature is probably also an essential parameter controlling the densification of ice-templated ceramics.},

  volume = {133},
  abstract = {Homogeneous contractility is usually assigned to the remote region, border zone (BZ), and the infarct in existing infarcted left ventricle (LV) mathematical models. Within the LV, the contractile function is therefore discontinuous. Here, we hypothesize that the BZ may in fact define a smooth linear transition in contractility between the remote region and the infarct. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model of a sheep LV having an anteroapical infarct with linearly-varying BZ contractility. Using an existing optimization method (Sun et al., 2009, "A Computationally Efficient Formal Optimization of Regional Myocardial Contractility in a Sheep With Left Ventricular Aneurysm," J. Biomech. Eng., 131(11), pp. 111001), we use that model to extract active material parameter T(max) and BZ width d(n) that "best" predict in-vivo systolic strain fields measured from tagged magnetic resonance images (MRI). We confirm our hypothesis by showing that our model, compared to one that has homogeneous contractility assigned in each region, reduces the mean square errors between the predicted and the measured strain fields. Because the peak fiber stress differs significantly ($\sim$15\%) between these two models, our result suggests that future mathematical LV models, particularly those used to analyze myocardial infarction treatment, should account for a smooth linear transition in contractility within the BZ.},

  abstract = {Cardiac growth and remodeling in the form of chamber dilation and wall thinning are typical hallmarks of infarct-induced heart failure. Over time, the infarct region stiffens, the remaining muscle takes over function, and the chamber weakens and dilates. Current therapies seek to attenuate these effects by removing the infarct region or by providing structural support to the ventricular wall. However, the underlying mechanisms of these therapies are unclear, and the results remain suboptimal. Here we show that myocardial infarction induces pronounced regional and transmural variations in cardiac form. We introduce a mechanistic growth model capable of predicting structural alterations in response to mechanical overload. Under a uniform loading, this model predicts non-uniform growth. Using this model, we simulate growth in a patient-specific left ventricle. We compare two cases, growth in an infarcted heart, pre-operative, and growth in the same heart, after the infarct was surgically excluded, post-operative. Our results suggest that removing the infarct and creating a left ventricle with homogeneous mechanical properties does not necessarily reduce the driving forces for growth and remodeling. These preliminary findings agree conceptually with clinical observations.},

  abstract = {This article describes a methodology for creating a generic volumetric biomechanical model from different image modalities and segmenting time series of medical images using this model. The construction of such a generic model consists of three stages: geometric meshing, non-rigid deformation of the mesh in images of various modalities, and image-to-mesh information mapping through rasterization. The non-rigid deformation stage, which relies on a combination of global and local deformations, can then be used to segment time series of images, e.g. cine MRI or gated SPECT cardiac images. We believe that this type of deformable biomechanical model can play an important role in the extraction of useful quantitative local parameters of cardiac function. The biomechanical model of the heart will be coupled with an electrical model of another collaborative project in order to simulate and analyze a larger class of pathologies. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Transendocardial stem cell injection (TESI) with mesenchymal stem cells improves remodeling in chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy, but the effect of the injection site remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To address whether TESI exerts its effects at the site of injection only or also in remote areas, we hypothesized that segmental myocardial scar and segmental ejection fraction improve to a greater extent in injected than in noninjected segments. METHODS AND RESULTS: Biplane ventriculographic and endocardial tracings were recorded. TESI was guided to 10 sites in infarct-border zones. Sites were mapped according to the 17-myocardial segment model. As a result, 510 segments were analyzed in 30 patients before and 13 months after TESI. Segmental early enhancement defect (a measure of scar size) was reduced by TESI in both injected (-43.7 $\pm$ 4.4\%; n=95; P$\backslash$textless0.01) and noninjected segments (-25.1 $\pm$ 7.8\%; n=148; P$\backslash$textless0.001; between-group comparison P$\backslash$textless0.05). Conversely, segmental ejection fraction (a measure of contractile performance) improved in injected scar segments (19.9 $\pm$ 3.3-26.3 $\pm$ 3.5\%; P=0.003) but not in noninjected scar segments (21.3 $\pm$ 2.6-23.5 $\pm$ 3.2\%; P=0.20; between-group comparison P$\backslash$textless0.05). Furthermore, segmental ejection fraction in injected scar segments improved to a greater degree in patients with baseline segmental ejection fraction $\backslash$textless20\% (12.1 $\pm$ 1.2-19.9 $\pm$ 2.7\%; n=18; P=0.003), versus $\backslash$textless20\% (31.7 $\pm$ 3.4-35.5 $\pm$ 3.3\%; n=12; P=0.33, between-group comparison P$\backslash$textless0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate a dichotomy in regional responses to TESI. Although scar size reduction was evident in all scar segments, scar size reduction and ventricular functional responses preferentially occurred at the sites of TESI versus non-TESI sites. Furthermore, improvement was greatest when segmental left ventricular dysfunction was severe.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel, monolithic, and unconditionally stable finite element algorithm for the bidomain-based approach to cardiac electromechanics. We introduce the transmembrane potential, the extracellular potential, and the displacement field as independent variables, and extend the common two-field bidomain formulation of electrophysiology to a three-field formulation of electromechanics. The intrinsic coupling arises from both excitation-induced contraction of cardiac cells and the deformation-induced generation of intra-cellular currents. The coupled reaction-diffusion equations of the electrical problem and the momentum balance of the mechanical problem are recast into their weak forms through a conventional isoparametric Galerkin approach. As a novel aspect, we propose a monolithic approach to solve the governing equations of excitation-contraction coupling in a fully coupled, implicit sense. We demonstrate the consistent linearization of the resulting set of non-linear residual equations. To assess the algorithmic performance, we illustrate characteristic features by means of representative three-dimensional initial-boundary value problems. The proposed algorithm may open new avenues to patient specific therapy design by circumventing stability and convergence issues inherent to conventional staggered solution schemes.},

With this assumption, a systematic and rigorous approach for formulating damaged elastic stress-strain relations is presented. The approach is based on the Fourier series representations of two naturally defined damage orientation distribution functions and on a theorem on elasticity tensors, and developed resorting neither to the notion of effective stress (strain) nor to the hypothesis of strain (stress) equivalence nor to that of elastic energy equivalence. The proposed approach is finally illustrated by applying it to initially isotropic materials and to unidirectional fiber-reinforced composites.},

The justification rests on developing a method to combine dimensional analysis of cohesive fracture with second-order accurate asymptotic matching. This method exploits the recently established general asymptotic properties of the cohesive crack model and nonlocal Weibull statistical model. The key idea is to select the dimensionless variables in such a way that, in each asymptotic case, all of them vanish except one. The minimal nature of the hypotheses made explains the surprisingly broad applicability of the scaling laws.},

We use the Bestel-Cl{\'e}ment-Sorine (BCS) electromechanical model of the heart, which provides reasonable accuracy with a reasonable number of parameters (14 for each ventricle) compared to the available clinical data at the organ level. We propose a personalization strategy from cine MRI data in two steps. We first estimate global parameters with an automatic calibration algorithm based on the Unscented Transform which allows to initialize the parameters while matching the volume and pressure curves. In a second step we locally personalize the contractilities of all AHA (American Heart Association) zones of the left ventricle using the reduced order unscented Kalman filtering on Regional Volumes. This personalization strategy was validated synthetically and tested successfully on eight healthy and three pathological cases.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the clinical feasibility and diagnostic performance of an acceleration technique based on k-space and time (k-t) sensitivity encoding (SENSE) for rapid, highspatial resolution cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) myocardial perfusion imaging. Background: The assessment of myocardial perfusion is of crucial importance in the evaluation of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. CMR myocardial perfusion imaging performs favorably compared to single photon-emission computed tomography and offers higher spatial resolution, particularly when combined with scan acceleration techniques such as k-t SENSE. A previous study showed that k-t SENSE accelerated myocardial perfusion CMR with 5-fold acceleration is feasible and delivers high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of coronary artery disease. Higher acceleration factors have not been attempted clinically because of concerns over temporal blurring effects of the time-varying signal during contrast bolus passage. Methods: Twenty patients underwent myocardial perfusion CMR imaging using a 3.0-T whole-body CMR imager before diagnostic X-ray coronary angiography. Perfusion images were obtained using an extension of the k-t SENSE method using parallel imaging to double the spatial resolution of the k-t SENSE training images. This extension, termed k-t SENSE+, permitted 8-fold nominal scan acceleration and an in-plane spatial resolution of up to 1.1 ?? 1.1 mm 2. Perfusion scores were derived by 2 blinded observers for 16 myocardial segments and compared to quantitative analysis of X-ray coronary angiography. Results: CMR data were successfully obtained in all 20 patients. High diagnostic accuracy was achieved using CMR, as reflected by areas under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of 0.94 and 0.82 for detecting stenoses $\backslash$textgreater50\% and $\backslash$textgreater75\%, respectively. Observer agreement between 2 readers had a kappa value of 0.92. The areas under the receiver-operator characteristic curves for the left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary artery territories with stenoses $\backslash$textgreater50\% were 0.75, 0.92, and 0.79, respectively. Conclusions: Accelerated CMR perfusion imaging is clinically feasible and offers excellent diagnostic performance in detecting coronary stenosis. ?? 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

  title = {Left Ventricular Fibre Architecture in Man},
  volume = {45},
  abstract = {In order to investigate the possibility of regional variation of ventricular structure, 25 normal postmortem human hearts were studied by inspection of cavity shape and subepicardial fibre orientation, by dissection, and by the histology of sections in two orthogonal planes. Ventricular architecture was complex. Inlet and outlet long axes were separated by 30 degrees in the left ventricle. In the right the corresponding figure was 90 degrees. The thickest part of the left ventricular wall was at the base. At the apex there was potential endo- and epicardial continuity. Left ventricular cavity shape departed significantly from any simple geometric figure, there being, consistently, regions of both positive and negative curvature on the diaphragmatic aspect. The presence of trabeculae caused considerable variation in wall thickness. Striking variation was found in the arrangement of subepicardial muscle fibres. Most pronounced was the contrast between the longitudinal arrangement of fibres observed on the oblique margin and the circumferential arrangement of those on the acute. On the diaphragmatic surface of the left ventricle, fibres near the crux and apex ran circumferentially while those between ran obliquely; those on the diaphragmatic surface of the right ventricle also ran circumferentially. Deeper in the myocardium the arrangement was simpler. In the mid-wall of the left ventricle fibres were circumferential, best developed towards the base and in the upper part of the septum. Near the apex of the left ventricle and in the mid-wall of the right ventricle such fibres were sparse. The subendocardial region consisted of longitudinally directed fibres forming the trabeculae and papillary muscles, while fibres deep to and between the trabeculae coursed more obliquely. These findings were confirmed by histology. Models based on uniform myocardial fibre structure cannot explain wall movement in normal subjects, and are likely to have significant limitations if used to investigated left ventricular function in disease.},

  abstract = {In order to model the mechanical behaviour of woven composite materials up to failure, we have adapted models developed for unidirectional plies and based on damage mechanics. The model used to describe the degradations is non-linear with progressive damage and inelastic strains. The behaviour of woven plies in the warp and fill directions is elastic and brittle. The progressive loss of rigidity (shear modulus) is described by a damage variable, the development of which depends on the shear load but also on the in-plane tension load. The inelastic strains concern only shear strains. The identification of the model was done by means of two tensile tests. A program that makes it possible to simulate the woven laminate behaviour was carried out. Validation tests, which compare numerical results and experimental results. have shown the relevance of the model. These tests show a lesser sensitivity of woven-ply laminates to delamination phenomena with respect to unidirectional plies. In the case of rc oven-ply laminates. the only inelastic damageable model of the ply should be sufficient to describe the behaviour of any laminate.},

Compositions with 50\% or more tri-calcium phosphate did not develop strengths much above 40 MPa and the strength of most compositions fell when the sintering temperature exceeded 1250 degrees C.

  abstract = {The failure of fibre bundles of Kevlar and glass has been monitored using mechanical load measurements and acoustic emission. It is shown that interfibre friction significantly reduces fibre bundle strength (sigma(b)) and the corresponding failure strain (epsilon(b)) The strength distribution of individual fibres is narrowed when testing unlubricated fibre bundles, and this is attributed to frictional interactions during the fibre fracture process. A simple graphical (LST) method for determining the Weibull parameters is discussed and compared to other previously proposed methods. Acoustic emission has proved useful in monitoring the exact time and load of fibre breaks, since the breaking of each individual fibre is accompanied by an associated acoustic signal. Care must be exercised when extracting Weibull parameters from data, in particular when employing methods involving In In plots. Beyond the maximum load attained by a fibre bundle, failure is found to occur by multiplet fibre breaks, and in this region different Weibull parameters apply. Including data from this region during a fibre bundle fracture test could lead to reduced accuracy when determining Weibull parameters.},

  abstract = {A cryomicroscope was used to determine critical interface velocities marking the transition between repulsion and entrapment of spherical latex particles by an advancingice\textemdash{}liquid interface. The employed freezing stage yields a planar ice front which propagates with increasing velocity into a region of decreasing thermal gradients. It was found that the critical velocity associated with the transition is inversely proportional to the particle radius as suggested theoretically under the assumption of the flat front (no cusping behind the particle). The critical velocity increases about linearly with the imposed thermal gradient which seems to stabilize the front against the perturbation induced by the particle. On the other hand, concentration gradients did not show a major effect: the addition of solute (0.56 mol\% NaMnO4) did not result in a significant change of the transition points as compared to the results obtained in pure water.},

Natural materials achieve their strength through complex hierarchical designs and anisotropic structures that are extremely difficult to replicate synthetically. We emulate nature's design by direct-ink-write assembling of glass scaffolds with a periodic pattern, and controlled sintering of the filaments into anisotropic constructs similar to biological materials. The final product is a porous glass scaffold with a compressive strength (136 MPa) comparable to that of cortical bone and a porosity (60\%) comparable to that of trabecular bone. The strength of this porous glass scaffold is $\sim$100 times that of polymer scaffolds and 4-5 times that of ceramic and glass scaffolds with comparable porosities reported elsewhere. The ability to create both porous and strong structures opens a new avenue for fabricating scaffolds for a broad array of applications, including tissue engineering, filtration, lightweight composites, and catalyst support.},

  title = {A Coupled Anisotropic Damage Model for the Inelastic Response of Composite Materials},
  volume = {183},
  abstract = {A coupled incremental damage and plasticity theory for rare-independent and rate-dependent composite materials is introduced here. This allows damage to be path-dependent either on the stress history or thermodynamic force conjugate to damage. This is achieved through the use of an incremental damage tensor. Damage and inelastic deformations are incorporated in the proposed model that is used for the analysis of fiber-reinforced metal-matrix composite materials. The damage is described kinematically in both the elastic and inelastic domains using the fourth-order damage effect tensor which is a function of the second-order damage tensor. A physical interpretation of the second-order damage tensor is given in this work which relates to the microcrack porosity within the unit cell. The inelastic deformation behavior with damage is viewed here within the framework of thermodynamics with internal state variables. Computational aspects of both the rate-independent and rate-dependent models are discussed in this work. The Newton-Rapson iterative scheme is used for the overall laminate system. The constitute equations of both the rate-independent and the rate-dependent plasticity coupled with damage models are additively decomposed into the elastic, inelastic and damage deformations by using the three-step split operator algorithm \{[\}J.W. Ju, Internat. J. Solids Struc. 25 (1989) 803-833]. The main framework return maping algorithm \{[\}M. Ortiz, C. Simo, Internat. J. Numer. Meth. Eng. 23 (1986) 353-366] is used for the correction of the elasto-plastic and viscoplastic states. However, for the case of the damage model these algorithms are redefined according to the governed damage constitutive relations, In order to test the validity of the model, a series of laminated systems (O-(8s)), (90((8s))), (0/90)((4s)), (-45/45)((2s)) are investigated at both room and elevated temperatures of 538 degrees C and 649 degrees C. The results obtained from the special purpose developed computer program, DVP-CALSET (Damage and Viscoplastic Coupled Analysis of Laminate Systems at Elevated Temperatures), ore then compared with the available experimental results and other existing theoretical material models obtained from the work of B.S. Majumdar, G.M.. Newaz \{[\}CR-1890951 NASA, 1992] and G.Z. Voyiadjis,, A.R. Venson \{[\}Internat. J. Damage Mech. 4 (4) (1995) 338-361].},

The dynamics of a 1 cm(3) slab of active cardiac tissue was simulated as the electrical wave traversed the muscular heart wall transmurally. The regular Newton (Newton-Raphson) method was compared to two modified Newton approaches, and also to a third approach that delayed update only of some selected Jacobian elements. In addition, the impact of changing the time step (0.01, 0.1 and 1 ms) and the relative non-linear convergence tolerance (10(-4), 10(-3) and 10(-2)) was investigated. Updating the Jacobian only when slow convergence occurred was by far the most efficient approach, giving time savings of 83-96\%. For each of the four methods, CPU times were reduced by 48-90\% when the time step was increased by a factor 10. Increasing the convergence tolerance by the same factor gave time savings of 3-71\%. Different combinations of activation wave speed, stress rate and bulk modulus revealed that the fastest method became relatively even faster as stress rate and bulk modulus was decreased, while the activation speed had negligible influence in this respect.},

Non-microporous (NMP) scaffolds contained only macroporosity (250-350 microm) and microporous (MP) scaffolds contained both macroporosity and microporosity (2-8 microm). Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) was incorporated into all scaffolds via gelatin microspheres prior to implantation into the latissimus dorsi muscle of Yorkshire pigs. After 8 weeks, only the MP scaffolds contained bone. The result demonstrates the efficacy of the MP scaffolds as drug carriers. Implanted and as-fabricated scaffolds were compared using histology, microcomputed tomography, scanning electron microscopy, and compression testing. Implanted scaffolds exhibited a stress-strain response similar to that of cancellous bone with strengths between those of cancellous and cortical bone. The strength and stiffness of implanted NMP scaffolds decreased by 15\% and 46\%, respectively. Implanted MP scaffolds lost 30\% of their strength and 31\% of their stiffness. Bone arrested crack propagation effectively in MP scaffolds. The change in mechanical behavior is discussed and the study demonstrates the importance of scaffold microporosity on bone ingrowth and on the mechanical behavior of HA implant materials.},

  abstract = {On the basis of results from modeling and experimental studies it has been hypothesized that myocytes adapt their orientation to achieve a preferred mechanical load. In a previous computational model study in which fiber reorientation was considered as a local response to local fiber cross-fiber shear strain, we have shown that predicted left ventricular (LV) myofiber orientations agreed well with experimental data. In this study, we investigated in the latter model the effect of initial and boundary conditions on predicted fiber orientations on the long term. After adaptation, predicted fiber orientation and deformation became more realistic, irrespective of initial and boundary conditions. As adaptation proceeded, the effect of initial conditions was found to disappear, suggesting that one single optimal fiber orientation field exists for the heart. In contrast, the effect of the boundary conditions persisted, indicating that modeling of in particular the interaction between myocardium and valvular annulus is relevant for predicting LV myofiber reorientation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  title = {{{DTI}} of Human Skeletal Muscle: The Effects of Diffusion Encoding Parameters, Signal-to-Noise Ratio and {{T2}} on Tensor Indices and Fiber Tracts},
  volume = {26},
  abstract = {In this study, we have performed simulations to address the effects of diffusion encoding parameters, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and T2 on skeletal muscle diffusion tensor indices and fiber tracts. Where appropriate, simulations were corroborated and validated by in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of human skeletal muscle. Specifically, we have addressed: (i) the accuracy and precision of the diffusion parameters and eigenvectors at different SNR levels; (ii) the effects of the diffusion gradient direction encoding scheme; (iii) the optimal b value for diffusion tensor estimation; (iv) the effects of changes in skeletal muscle T2; and, finally, the influence of SNR on fiber tractography and derived (v) fiber lengths, (vi) pennation angles and (vii) fiber curvatures. We conclude that accurate DTI of skeletal muscle requires an SNR of at least 25, a b value of between 400 and 500 s/mm(2), and data acquired with at least 12 diffusion gradient directions homogeneously distributed on half a sphere. Furthermore, for DTI studies focusing on skeletal muscle injury or pathology, apparent changes in the diffusion parameters need to be interpreted with great care in view of the confounding effects of T2, particularly for moderate to low SNR values.},

The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of scar burden on response to CRT. We included 34 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association class 3.1 +/- 0.4, LV ejection fraction 23 +/- 7\%). Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine total scar burden, using a 17-segment model with a 5-point hyperenhancement scale (from score 0 = no hyperenhancement, indicating no scar, to score 4 = hyperenhancement $\backslash$textgreater76\%, transmural scar). Linear regression analysis showed a significant correlation (r = -0.91, p $\backslash$textless0.05) between total scar burden at baseline and change in LV end-systolic volume after 6 months of CRT. Also, patients not responding to CRT had significantly more scar tissue than responders. A scar burden $\backslash$textgreater1.20 resulted in complete functional nonresponse. In conclusion, total scar burden, assessed using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, is an important factor influencing response to CRT and may be included in the selection process for CRT candidates.},

These 3D methods were evaluated in five healthy volunteers, using 2D cine DENSE and historical 3D myocardial tagging as reference standards. With an average scan time of 20.5 $\pm$ 5.7 min, 3D data sets with a matrix size of 128 \texttimes{} 128 \texttimes{} 22, voxel size of 2.8 \texttimes{} 2.8 \texttimes{} 5.0 mm(3), and temporal resolution of 32 msec were obtained with displacement encoding in three orthogonal directions.

Transmural strain gradients were detected in the radial and circumferential directions, reflecting high spatial resolution. Good agreement by linear correlation and Bland-Altman analysis was achieved when comparing normal strains measured by 2D and 3D cine DENSE. Also, the 3D strains, twist, and torsion results obtained by 3D cine DENSE were in good agreement with historical values measured by 3D myocardial tagging.},

The damage variable is still related to the surface density of microcracks and microvoids, and, as its evolution is governed by the plastic strain, it is represented by a second-order tensor and is orthotropic. The coupling of damage with elasticity is expressed in tensor form on the deviatoric part of the stress tensor and in scalar form by its trace on the hydrostatic part. The kinetic law of damage evolution is an extension of the isotropic case. Here the principal components of the damage rate tensor are proportional to the absolute value of the principal components of the plastic strain rate tensor The proposed damage evolution law does not introduce any other material parameter Several series of experiments give a good validation of this theory.},

Progress has been made in our understanding of the structural and molecular characteristics of physiological cardiac hypertrophy, as well as of the endocrine effectors and associated signalling pathways that regulate it. Physiological hypertrophy is initiated by finite signals, which include growth hormones (such as thyroid hormone, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor) and mechanical forces that converge on a limited number of intracellular signalling pathways (such as PI3K, AKT, AMP-activated protein kinase and mTOR) to affect gene transcription, protein translation and metabolism.

After a brief review of the statistical weakest-link model, distinctions between structures that fail by initiation of macroscopic crack growth (metal structures) and structures that exhibit large macroscopic crack growth prior to failure (quasi-brittle structures) are pointed out. It is shown that the classical Weibull-type approach ignores the stress redistributions and energy release due to stable large fracture growth prior to failure, which causes a strong deterministic size effect. Further, it is shown that, according to this classical theory, every structure is equivalent to a uniaxially loaded bar of variable cross section, which means that the mechanics of the failure process is ignored.

Next, the model is validated by experimental data and periodic three-dimensional unit cell calculations comprising various fiber volume fractions and mechanical properties of the constituents. The model is found to be in very good agreement with both the experimental data and the finite element results for all the examined cases.

  abstract = {A mathematical description of cardiac anatomy is presented for use with finite element models of the electrical activation and mechanical function of the heart. The geometry of the heart is given in terms of prolate spheroidal coordinates defined at the nodes of a finite element mesh and interpolated within elements by a combination of linear Lagrange and cubic Hermite basis functions. Cardiac microstructure is assumed to have three axes of symmetry: one aligned with the muscle fiber orientation (the fiber axis); a second set orthogonal to the fiber direction and lying in the newly identified myocardial sheet plane (the sheet axis); and a third set orthogonal to the first two, in the sheet-normal direction. The geometry, fiber-axis direction, and sheet-axis direction of a dog heart are fitted with parameters defined at the nodes of the finite element mesh. The fiber and sheet orientation parameters are defined with respect to the ventricular geometry such that 1) they can be applied to any heart of known dimensions, and 2) they can be used for the same heart at various states of deformation, as is needed, for example, in continuum models of ventricular contraction.},

  doi = {10.1007/s10237-012-0442-3},
  abstract = {Incompressible nonlinearly hyperelastic materials are rarely simulated in finite element numerical experiments as being perfectly incompressible because of the numerical difficulties associated with globally satisfying this constraint. Most commercial finite element packages therefore assume that the material is slightly compressible. It is then further assumed that the corresponding strain-energy function can be decomposed additively into volumetric and deviatoric parts. We show that this decomposition is not physically realistic, especially for anisotropic materials, which are of particular interest for simulating the mechanical response of biological soft tissue. The most striking illustration of the shortcoming is that with this decomposition, an anisotropic cube under hydrostatic tension deforms into another cube instead of a hexahedron with non-parallel faces. Furthermore, commercial numerical codes require the specification of a 'compressibility parameter' (or 'penalty factor'), which arises naturally from the flawed additive decomposition of the strain-energy function. This parameter is often linked to a 'bulk modulus', although this notion makes no sense for anisotropic solids; we show that it is essentially an arbitrary parameter and that infinitesimal changes to it result in significant changes in the predicted stress response. This is illustrated with numerical simulations for biaxial tension experiments of arteries, where the magnitude of the stress response is found to change by several orders of magnitude when infinitesimal changes in 'Poisson's ratio' close to the perfect incompressibility limit of 1/2 are made.},

  abstract = {IntroductionMyocardial infarct pathologies, including intramyocardial haemorrhage (IMH) and microvascular obstruction (MVO) are complex dynamic traits affecting around half of all survivors of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We aimed to characterise the evolution and inter-relationships between IMH and MVO in STEMI survivors to inform and implement novel therapeutic interventions. MethodsWe undertook a single centre cohort study in 288 reperfused STEMI patients treated by emergency PCI (BHF MR-MI study; NCT02072850). IMR, a prognostically validated invasive microcirculatory biomarker, was measured acutely at the end of PCI using guide-wire based-thermodilution. IMH (T2* value $\backslash$textless20 ms) and MVO were delineated as a hypointense on T2* mapping and CE-CMR, respectively, 2 days and 6 months post-MI. Time-course CMR: 30 patients underwent serial CMR at 4 time-points: 4 to 12 h, 3 days, 10 days and 6-7 months post reperfusion. Adverse remodelling was defined as an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) [\&ge;]20\% at 6 months. All-cause death or heart failure (ACD/HF) was independently assessed during follow-up. A randomised proof-of-concept clinical trial of deferred PCI vs. immediate stenting was implemented for treatment stratification. ResultsThe median IMR [IQR] post-PCI was 24 [15-44] (n = 288). 245 STEMI patients (86\%) had evaluable T2*-CMR and 101 patients (41\%) had IMH. All of the patients with IMH had MVO, but 32 patients had MVO (13\%) without IMH. IMR was higher in patients with IMH (37 [21-63]) than in patients without IMH (17 [12-33]). Using ROC analysis, the optimal cut-off for IMR in predicting IMH was 27 [AUC 0.73 (0.66, 0.79)]. The IMR cut-off of for MVO was 23.5 [AUC 0.68 (0.61, 0.75)]. IMR was more strongly associated with IMH (odds ratio 4.24 (2.38, 7.58); p $\backslash$textless 0.001), than for MVO (2.84 (1.70, 4.73); p $\backslash$textless 0.001). IMR was independently associated with adverse remodelling (1.01 (1.00, 1.03); p = 0.006) and NT-proBNP at 6 months (4.64 (2.17, 7.12); p $\backslash$textless 0.001). IMR was an associate of ACD/HF (n = 30 events during admission and post-discharge (1.016 (1.009, 1.023); p $\backslash$textless 0.001). Serial CMR (n = 30): IMH occurred in 7 (23\%), 13 (43\%), 11 (33\%), and 4 (13\%) patients at 4-12 h, 3 days, 10 days and 7 months, respectively. The amount of MVO was greatest 4-12 h post-reperfusion, then fell progressively over time. In contrast, the amount of IMH increased dynamically from 4-12 h with a peak at 3 days then a decrease at 10 days. MVO resolved by day 10 in 8 patients (44\%), 2 (25\%) of whom had evidence of IMH. Whereas MVO persisted in 10 patients (56\%), all (100\%) of whom had evidence of IMH. IMR values in the highest tertile were associated with all cause death or heart failure hospitalisation (HR 3.30 (1.59, 6.86); p = 0.001) (censor time 839 (598 to 1099) days). IMH was associated with ACD/HF post-discharge (hazard ratio (95\% CI): 12.9 (1.6, 100.8); p = 0.015). In a proof-of-concept pilot trial, of 411 consecutive STEMI patients, 101 were randomised (March-Nov 2012). Compared with standard care with immediate stenting (n = 49), brief (median 9 (6-12) hours) deferral of stenting following reperfusion (n = 52) tended to reduce IMH and MVO and increased myocardial salvage. ConclusionIMH and MVO follow divergent time-courses. IMR is strongly associated with IMH which is indicative of severe MI. IMR has potential to stratify patients acutely and deferred PCI is a simple intervention that could be implemented worldwide, if a planned Phase 3 trial confirms the hypothesis.},

  abstract = {In vivo imaging of cardiac 3D fibre architecture is still a practical and methodological challenge. However it potentially provides important clinical insights, for example leading to a better understanding of the pathophysiology and the follow up of ventricular remodelling after therapy. Recently, the acquisition of 2D multi-slice Diffusion Tensor Images (DTI) of the in vivo human heart has become feasible, yielding a limited number of slices with relatively poor signal-to-noise ratios. In this article, we present a method to analyse the fibre architecture of the left ventricle (LV) using shape-based transformation into a normalised Prolate Spheroidal coordinate frame. Secondly, a dense approximation scheme of the complete 3D cardiac fibre architecture of the LV from a limited number of DTI slices is proposed and validated using ex vivo data. Those two methods are applied in vivo to a group of healthy volunteers, on which 2D DTI slices of the LV were acquired using a free-breathing motion compensated protocol. Results demonstrate the advantages of using curvilinear coordinates both for the anaylsis and the interpolation of cardiac DTI information. Resulting in vivo fibre architecture was found to agree with data from previous studies on ex vivo hearts. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Many studies have shown that mechanical loads affect diverse cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, ECM gene and protein expression, and the production of soluble factors. Major cellular components involved in the mechanotransduction mechanisms include the cytoskeleton, integrins, G proteins, receptor tyrosine kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and stretch-activated ion channels.

  abstract = {We studied the effects of regional ischemia on the left ventricular isovolumic end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) in six excised, blood-perfused canine ventricles. We created different extents of regional ischemia by ligating various branches of the coronary arteries while keeping the coronary arterial pressure constant (80 mm Hg). The extent of regional ischemia (Rm) relative to the total mass of the left ventricular myocardium was determined by regional myocardial blood flow measured by the radioactive microsphere technique. With regional ischemia, the ESPVR shifted rightward without significant change in slope in the physiologic end-systolic pressure range. In the subphysiological end-systolic pressure range, however, its slope became lower than control. In order to quantify the degree of the rightward shift, we measured the extrapolated volume axis intercept (Vo) by fitting a straight line to the ESPVR in the physiological range under control and ischemic conditions. The shift in Vo (delta Vo) associated with ischemia was linearly correlated with Rm (delta Vo = 50.7Rm-0.6, n = 28, r = 0.944, P less than 0.001). We conclude that the major effect of acute regional ischemia on the ESPVR in the physiological pressure range is a parallel rightward shift. This forms a striking contrast to the effect of global ischemia (under which only the slope is affected without a substantial change in Vo).},

  abstract = {Over the past years, model reduction techniques have become a necessary path for the reduction of computational requirements in the numerical simulation of complex models. A family of a priori model reduction techniques, called Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) methods, are receiving a growing interest. These methods rely on the a priori construction of separated variables representations of the solution of models defined in tensor product spaces. They can be interpreted as generalizations of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for the a priori construction of such separated representations. In this paper, we introduce and study different definitions of PGD for the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations. We review classical definitions of PGD based on Galerkin or Minimal Residual formulations and we propose and discuss several improvements for these classical definitions. We give an interpretation of optimal decompositions as the solution of pseudo-eigenproblems. We also introduce a new definition of PGD, called Minimax PGD, which can be interpreted as a Petrov\textendash{}Galerkin model reduction technique, where test and trial reduced basis functions are related by an adjoint problem. This new definition improves convergence properties of separated representations with respect to a chosen metric. It coincides with a classical POD for degenerate time-dependent partial differential equations. For the numerical construction of each PGD, we propose algorithms inspired from the solution of eigenproblems. Several numerical examples illustrate and compare the different definitions of PGD on transient advection\textendash{}diffusion\textendash{}reaction equations.},

  abstract = {A general multiaxial theory for the constitutive relations in fibrous connective tissues is developed on the basis of microstructural and thermodynamic considerations. It is compatible with existing general material theories. In elastic tissues, the theory considers the strain-energy function to be the sum of strain-energies of the tissue's components. The stresses are derived from this strain-energy function. Viscoelastic constitutive relations are obtained in an analogous manner. Few examples are developed in detail. The results of the present strain-energy based theory are identical with those of the author's previous structural models (Lanir, 1979a, b) which are based on detailed equilibrium analysis. It turns out, however, that the analytical work involved in solving boundary value problems is considerably shorter if the present theory is used. The advantages of structural theories in avoiding ambiguity in material characterization and in offering an insight into the function, structure and mechanics of tissue components are discussed.},

  abstract = {The current focus of medicine on molecular genetics ignores the physical basis of disease even though many of the problems that lead to pain and morbidity, and bring patients to the doctor's office, result from changes in tissue structure or mechanics. The main goal of this article is therefore to help integrate mechanics into our understanding of the molecular basis of disease. This article first reviews the key roles that physical forces, extracellular matrix and cell structure play in the control of normal development, as well as in the maintenance of tissue form and function. Recent insights into cellular mechanotransduction - the molecular mechanism by which cells sense and respond to mechanical stress - also are described. Re-evaluation of human pathophysiology in this context reveals that a wide range of diseases included within virtually all fields of medicine and surgery share a common feature: their etiology or clinical presentation results from abnormal mechanotransduction. This process may be altered by changes in cell mechanics, variations in extracellular matrix structure, or by deregulation of the molecular mechanisms by which cells sense mechanical signals and convert them into a chemical or electrical response. Molecules that mediate mechanotransduction, including extracellular matrix molecules, transmembrane integrin receptors, cytoskeletal structures and associated signal transduction components, may therefore represent targets for therapeutic intervention in a variety of diseases. Insights into the mechanical basis of tissue regulation also may lead to development of improved medical devices, engineered tissues, and biologically-inspired materials for tissue repair and reconstruction.},

We sought to detail significant recent improvements to the Dassault Syst{\`e}mes Living Heart Model (LHM) and use the LHM to compute left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) myofiber stress distributions under the following 4 conditions: (1) normal cardiac function; (2) acute left heart failure (ALHF); (3) ALHF treated using an LV assist device (LVAD) flow rate of 2 L/min; and (4) ALHF treated using an LVAD flow rate of 4.5 L/min. Methods and Results. Incorporating improved systolic myocardial material properties in the LHM resulted in its ability to simulate the Frank-Starling law of the heart. We decreased myocardial contractility in the LV myocardium so that LV ejection fraction decreased from 56\% to 28\%. This caused mean LV end diastolic (ED) stress to increase to 508\% of normal, mean LV end systolic (ES) stress to increase to 113\% of normal, mean RV ED stress to decrease to 94\% of normal and RV ES to increase to 570\% of normal. When ALHF in the model was treated with an LVAD flow rate of 4.5 L/min, most stress results normalized. Mean LV ED stress became 85\% of normal, mean LV ES stress became 109\% of normal and mean RV ED stress became 95\% of normal. However, mean RV ES stress improved less dramatically (to 342\% of normal values). Conclusions. These simulations strongly suggest that an LVAD is effective in normalizing LV stresses but not RV stresses that become elevated as a result of ALHF.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conventional activation mapping in the dilated human left ventricle (LV) with left bundle-branch block (LBBB) morphology is incomplete given the limited number of recording sites that may be collected in a reasonable time and given the lack of precision in marking specific anatomic locations. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied LV activation sequences in 24 patients with heart failure and LBBB QRS morphology with simultaneous application of 3D contact and noncontact mapping during intrinsic rhythm and asynchronous pacing. Approximately one third of the patients with typical LBBB QRS morphology had normal transseptal activation time and a slightly prolonged or near-normal LV endocardial activation time. A "U-shaped" activation wave front was present in 23 patients because of a line of block that was located anteriorly (n=12), laterally (n=8), and inferiorly (n=3). Patients with a lateral line of block had significantly shorter QRS (P$\backslash$textless0.003) and transseptal durations (P$\backslash$textless0.001) and a longer distance from the LV breakthrough site to line of block (P$\backslash$textless0.03). Functional behavior of the line of block was demonstrated by a change in its location during asynchronous ventricular pacing at different sites and cycle lengths. CONCLUSIONS: A U-shaped conduction pattern is imposed on the LV activation sequence by a transmural functional line of block located between the LV septum and the lateral wall with a prolonged activation time. Assessment of functional block is facilitated by noncontact mapping, which may be useful for identifying and targeting specific locations that are optimal for successful cardiac resynchronization therapy.},

  abstract = {The knowledge of the mechanical behaviour of woven composite reinforcements is necessary to analyse and simulate the forming processes of these composites. Tensile rigidities of fabrics are large compared to others and they mainly drive the deformation. The tensile behaviour of woven reinforcements is specific because the undulations due to weaving lead to strong non-linearities at the beginning of the loading. These undulations in both directions lead to a biaxial phenomenon. In the present paper, a simplified biaxial tensile model gives the tension response for all warp and weft strains with very fast computations. It can be used to carry out optimization of the parameters of the woven reinforcement. This model is based on a consistent description of the fabric geometry. Contrary to most others models it strictly avoids spurious voids and interpenetrations of the yarns due to geometrical assumptions. The geometrical model remains nevertheless simple and requires three or six dimensional parameters according to whether the fabric is balanced or not. The simplified mechanical model based on this geometrical description is a truss type model. From the local equilibrium equations of woven yarns, it relates the tensions in the warp and weft directions to the axial strains in these two directions. The tensile surfaces are obtained very quickly and are in good agreement with results of experimental biaxial tests.},

  abstract = {Time-resolved three-dimensional flow measurements are limited by long acquisition times. Among the various acceleration techniques available, k-t methods have shown potential as they permit significant scan time reduction even with a single receive coil by exploiting spatiotemporal correlations. In this work, an extension of k-t principal component analysis is proposed utilizing signal differences between the velocity encodings of three-directional flow measurements to further compact the signal representation and hence improve reconstruction accuracy. The effect of sparsity transform in k-t principal component analysis is demonstrated using simulated and measured data of the carotid bifurcation. Deploying sparsity transform for 8-fold undersampled simulated data, velocity root-mean-square errors were found to decrease by 52 $\pm$ 14\%, 59 $\pm$ 11\%, and 16 $\pm$ 32\% in the common, external, and internal carotid artery, respectively. In vivo, errors were reduced by 15 $\pm$ 17\% in the common carotid artery with sparsity transform. Based on these findings, spatial resolution of three-dimensional flow measurements was increased to 0.8 mm isotropic resolution with prospective 8-fold undersampling and sparsity transform k-t principal component analysis reconstruction. Volumetric data were acquired in 6 min. Pathline visualization revealed details of helical flow patterns partially hidden at lower spatial resolution.},

Following a rigorous scale change methodology, the macroscopic free energy of the microcracked medium is built considering either open and closed microcracks. Moreover, the microcracks opening/closure criterion as well as the moduli recovery conditions (unilateral effects) are addressed in stress-based and strain-based formulations. An alternative derivation of the homogenized properties, based on the well-known Eshelby method, is also presented and extended here to closed cracks. From the micromechanical analysis, an energy-based yield condition is formulated and illustrated in various stress subspaces. Assuming that the normality rule applies, we then present the damage evolution law and the rate form of the constitutive model. The main capabilities and advantages of the micromechanical model are illustrated through various examples in which material microstructure evolutions are presented.},

  abstract = {The bidomain model, coupled with accurate models of cell membrane kinetics, is generally believed to provide a reasonable basis for numerical simulations of cardiac electrophysiology. Because of changes occurring in very short time intervals and over small spatial domains, discretized versions of these models must be solved on fine computational grids, and small time-steps must be applied. This leads to huge computational challenges that have been addressed by several authors. One popular way of reducing the CPU demands is to approximate the bidomain model by the monodomain model, and thus reducing a two by two set of partial differential equations to one scalar partial differential equation; both of which are coupled to a set of ordinary differential equations modeling the cell membrane kinetics. A reduction in CPU time of two orders of magnitude has been reported. It is the purpose of the present paper to provide arguments that such a reduction is not present when order-optimal numerical methods are applied. Theoretical considerations and numerical experiments indicate that the reduction factor of the CPU requirements from bidomain to monodomain computations, using order-optimal methods, typically is about 10 for simple cell models and less than two for more complex cell models.},

The present paper investigates the oxidation of the fibers during static fatigue, at temperatures in the intermediate temperature range (500 degrees-800 degrees C). Two oxidation-induced phenomena have been evidenced: the formation of a thin silica film at the surface of fibers and the delayed failure of fiber bundles and single filaments. The stress-rupture time data are interpreted with respect to the chemical and structural characteristics of fibers, and to the oxide film growth rate. The structural analysis of the fibers was carried out using scanning electron microscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy. Delayed failure was found to result from slow crack propagation from surface defects, as a result of the consumption of the free carbon at grain boundaries and the local stresses induced by the SiC -$\backslash$textgreater SiO2 transformation at the crack tip. The respective contributions of these phenomena to static fatigue are discussed.},

  abstract = {Numerical modelling of the cardiovascular system is becoming an important tool for assessing the influence of heart disease and treatment therapies. In the current study, we present an approach for modelling the interaction between the heart and the circulatory system. This was accomplished by creating animal-specific biventricular finite element (FE) models, which characterise the mechanical response of the heart, and by coupling them to a lumped-parameter model that represents the systemic and pulmonic circulatory system. In order to minimise computation time, the coupling was enforced in a weak (one-way) manner, where the ventricular pressure-volume relationships were generated by the FE models and then passed into the circulatory system model to ensure volume conservation and physiological pressure changes. The models were first validated by tuning the parameters, such that the output of the models matched experimentally measured pressures and volumes. Then the models were used to examine cardiac function and the myofibre stress in a healthy canine heart and a canine heart with dilated cardiomyopathy. The results showed good agreement with experimental measurements. The stress in the case of cardiomyopathy was found to increase significantly, while the pump function was decreased, compared to the healthy case. The total runtime of the simulations is lesser than that of many fully coupled models presented in the literature. This will allow for a much quicker evaluation of possible treatment strategies for combating the effects of heart failure, especially in optimisation schemes that require numerous FE simulations.},

  abstract = {Model reduction in computational mechanics is generally addressed with linear dimensionality reduction methods such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Hypothesizing that in many applications of interest the essential dynamics evolve on a nonlinear manifold, we explore here reduced order modeling based on nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods. Such methods are gaining popularity in diverse fields of science and technology, such as machine perception or molecular simulation. We consider finite deformation elastodynamics as a model problem, and identify the manifold where the dynamics essentially take place \textendash{} the slow manifold \textendash{} by nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods applied to a database of snapshots. Contrary to linear dimensionality reduction, the smooth parametrization of the slow manifold needs special techniques, and we use local maximum entropy approximants. We then formulate the Lagrangian mechanics on these data-based generalized coordinates, and develop variational time-integrators. Our proof-of-concept example shows that a few nonlinear collective variables provide similar accuracy to tens of PCA modes, suggesting that the proposed method may be very attractive in control or optimization applications. Furthermore, the reduced number of variables brings insight into the mechanics of the system under scrutiny. Our simulations also highlight the need of modeling the net effect of the disregarded degrees of freedom on the reduced dynamics at long times.},

A typical example is a conformational change in myosin II responsible for the power-stroke in skeletal muscles. In this paper we present an athermal perspective on such folding by analyzing the simplest purely mechanical prototype: a parallel bundle of bi-stable units attached to a common backbone. We show that in this analytically transparent model, characterized by a rugged energy landscape, the ground states are always highly coherent, single-phase configurations. We argue that such cooperative behavior, ensuring collective conformational change, is due to the dominance of long- range interactions making the system non-additive. The detailed predictions of our model are in agreement with experimentally observed non-equivalence of fast force recovery in skeletal muscles loaded in soft and hard devices. Some features displayed by the model are also recognizable in the behavior of other biological systems with passive multi-stability and long-range interactions including detaching adhesive binders and pulled RNA/DNA hairpins.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jacc.2009.08.045},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the impact of the left ventricular (LV) pacing site on hemodynamic response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). BACKGROUND: CRT reduces morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients. However, 20\% to 40\% of eligible patients may not fully benefit from CRT device implantation. We hypothesized that selecting the optimal LV pacing site could be critical in this issue. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy referred for CRT device implantation were studied. Intraventricular dyssynchrony and latest activated LV wall were defined by tissue Doppler imaging analysis before the study. Eleven predetermined LV pacing sites were systematically assessed in random order: basal and mid-cavity (septal, anterior, lateral, inferior), apex, coronary sinus (CS), and the endocardial site facing the CS pacing site. For each patient, +dP/dT(max), -dP/dT(min), pulse pressure, and end-systolic pressure during baseline (AAI) and DDD LV pacing were compared. Two atrioventricular delays were tested. RESULTS: Major interindividual and intraindividual variations of hemodynamic response depending on the LV pacing site were observed. Compared with baseline, LV DDD pacing at the best LV position significantly improved +dP/dT(max) (+31 +/- 26\%, p $\backslash$textless 0.001) and was superior to pacing the CS (+15 +/- 23\%, p $\backslash$textless 0.001), the lateral LV wall (+18 +/- 22\%, p $\backslash$textless 0.001), or the latest activated LV wall (+11 +/- 17\%, p $\backslash$textless 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The pacing site is a primary determinant of the hemodynamic response to LV pacing in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Pacing at the best LV site is associated acutely with fewer nonresponders and twice the improvement in +dP/dT(max) observed with CS pacing.},

  abstract = {In this paper nonlinear cohesive fracture models with cohesive parameters and laminar elasticity typical of polymer composites are used to study the initiation and propagation of a transverse intra-ply crack that is coupled to possible delaminations at the ply interfaces in a \{[\}0/90/0A degrees] laminate. The evolution of the transverse crack is found to be more complex than previously described, involving initial growth, growth along the ply in a tunneling mode, and expansion across the thickness of the ply in a plane strain mode. For the coupled crack system, two failure modes are distinguished: (1) complete tunneling propagation of the transverse crack before any delamination occurs, followed by delamination initiation and propagation; and (2) simultaneous propagation of the transverse and delaminations cracks. The former process is always stable, is favored by large values of the mode II to mode I toughness ratio and low values of the cohesive strength, and is predicted to be the prevalent failure sequence for polymer composites. The latter process is often unstable, because it tends to occur when the cohesive strength is so high that the stress for initiating the transverse crack exceeds the stress required for its tunneling propagation. The nonlinear fracture models provide a unified description of the entire process of initiation and crack propagation. If the delamination cracks are modeled by linear elastic fracture mechanics, substantially inaccurate predictions result for the onset of delamination cracking and for the tunneling crack initiation from a pre-existing flaw.},

  abstract = {The protein actin is a part of the cytoskeleton and, therefore, responsible for the mechanical properties of the cells. Starting with the single molecule up to the final structure, actin creates a hierarchical structure of several levels exhibiting a remarkable behavior. The hierarchy spans several length scales and limitations in computational power; therefore, there is a call for different mechanical modeling approaches for the different scales. On the molecular level, we may consider each atom in molecular dynamics simulations. Actin forms filaments by combining the molecules into a double helix. In a model, we replace molecular subdomains using coarse-graining methods, allowing the investigation of larger systems of several atoms. These models on the nanoscale inform continuum mechanical models of large filaments, which are based on worm-like chain models for polymers. Assemblies of actin filaments are connected with cross-linker proteins. Models with discrete filaments, so-called Mikado models, allow us to investigate the dependence of the properties of networks on the parameters of the constituents. Microstructurally motivated continuum models of the networks provide insights into larger systems containing cross-linked actin networks. Modeling of such systems helps to gain insight into the processes on such small scales. On the other hand, they call for verification and hence trigger the improvement of established experiments and the development of new methods.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A technical advance in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has significantly improved image quality. We investigated whether healed myocardial infarction can be visualised as hyperenhanced regions with this new technique, and whether assessment of the transmural extent of infarction yields new physiological data. METHODS: 82 MRI examinations were carried out in three groups: patients with healed myocardial infarction; patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy; and healthy volunteers. Patients with healed myocardial infarction were prospectively enrolled after enyzmatically proven necrosis and imaged 3 months (SD 1) or 14 months (7) later. The MRI procedure used a segmented inversion-recovery gradient-echo sequence after gadolinium administration. Findings were compared with those of coronary angiography, electrocardiography, cine MRI, and creatine kinase measurements. FINDINGS: 29 (91\%) of 32 patients with infarcts imaged at 3 months (13 non-Q-wave) and all of 19 imaged at 14 months (eight non-Q-wave) showed hyperenhancement. In patients in whom the infarct-related-artery was identified by angiography, 24 of 25 imaged at 3 months and all of 14 imaged at 14 months had hyperenhancement in the appropriate territory. None of the 20 patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy or the 11 healthy volunteers showed hyperenhancement. Irrespective of the presence or absence of Q waves, the majority of patients with hyperenhancement had only non-transmural involvement. Normal left-ventricular contraction was shown in seven patients examined at 3 months and three examined at 14 months, but in these cases hyperenhancement was limited to the subendocardium. INTERPRETATION: The presence, location, and transmural extent of healed Q-wave and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction can be accurately determined by contrast-enhanced MRI.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scar heterogeneity identified with contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CE-CMR) has been related to its arrhythmogenic potential by using different algorithms. The purpose of the study was to identify the algorithm that best fits with the electroanatomic voltage maps (EAM) to guide ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three-dimensional scar reconstructions from preprocedural CE-CMR study at 3T were obtained and compared with EAMs of 10 ischemic patients submitted for a VT ablation. Three-dimensional scar reconstructions were created for the core (3D-CORE) and border zone (3D-BZ), applying cutoff values of 50\%, 60\%, and 70\% of the maximum pixel signal intensity to discriminate between core and BZ. The left ventricular cavity from CE-CMR (3D-LV) was merged with the EAM, and the 3D-CORE and 3D-BZ were compared with the corresponding EAM areas defined with standard cutoff voltage values. The best match was obtained when a cutoff value of 60\% of the maximum pixel signal intensity was used, both for core (r(2)=0.827; P$\backslash$textless0.001) and BZ (r(2)=0.511; P=0.020), identifying 69\% of conducting channels (CC) observed in the EAM. Matching improved when only the subendocardial half of the wall was segmented (CORE: r(2)=0.808; P$\backslash$textless0.001 and BZ: r(2)=0.485; P=0.025), identifying 81\% of CC. When comparing the location of each bipolar voltage intracardiac electrogram with respect to the 3D CE-CMR-derived structures, a Cohen $\kappa$ coefficient of 0.70 was obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Scar characterization by means of high resolution CE-CMR resembles that of EAM and can be integrated into the CARTO system to guide VT ablation.},

  volume = {2},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We used diffusion-tensor cardiac MR to investigate myocardial microstructure changes, including tissue integrity (mean diffusivity [MD], fractional anisotropy) and fiber architecture (helix angles) in patients with recent myocardial infarction (MI). This study aimed to investigate the sequential changes of myocardial microstructure and its relationships with changes of macrostructure and function of the left ventricle post-MI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventeen patients (age, 55.1+/-11.5 years; all men) participated in the follow-up study. Diffusion-tensor cardiac MR, cine gradient echo for left ventricle function, and late gadolinium enhancement for viability were measured from recent to chronic MI (median interval, 191 days). When compared with the remote zone, the infarct-adjacent zone showed overall increase of MD (2-way MANOVA, F(1,16)=36.3; P$\backslash$textless0.001), decrease of fractional anisotropy (F(1,16)=5.8; P=0.029), and decrease of mean helix angles (F(1,16)=62.0; P$\backslash$textless0.001). From recent to chronic MI, there was overall sequential decrease of MD (F(1,16)=22.6; P$\backslash$textless0.001) and increase of fractional anisotropy (F(1,16)=7.8; P=0.013). Multiple linear regression showed that the improvement of wall thickening in the infarct-adjacent zone correlated with sequential decrease of MD in the infarct-adjacent zone (r=-0.70; P=0.002) and increase of mean helix angles (ie, more right-handed helical myofiber reorientation, predominantly subendocardial location) in the remote zone (r=0.60; P=0.011). Likewise, wall thickening in the remote zone correlated with MD in the remote zone (r=-0.72; P=0.001) and mean helix angles in the infarct-adjacent zone (r=0.72; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion-tensor cardiac MR suggests that sequential zonal improvement of tissue integrity and fiber architecture remodeling both associate with sequential recovery of zonal wall thickening of the left ventricle from recent to chronic MI.},

Such geometries therefore represent a deformed configuration stressed by typical in vivo conditions. Commonly, such structures are considered stress free in simulation. In this contribution we present and compare two methods to introduce a physically meaningful stress/strain state to the obtained geometry for simulations in the finite strain regime and demonstrate the necessity of such prestressing techniques. One method is based on an inverse design analysis to calculate a stress-free reference configuration. The other method developed here is based on a modified updated Lagrangian formulation. The formulation of both methods is provided in detail and implementation issues are discussed. Applicability and accurateness of both approaches are compared and evaluated utilizing an analytical aorta model and fully three-dimensional patient-specific abdominal aortic aneurysm structures in the finite strain regime.

In this paper, we formulate a novel Reduced-order Unscented Kalman Filter (rUKF) applied to the left ventricular (LV) nonlinear mechanical model based on cubic-Hermite finite elements. Material parameters in the widely-employed transversely isotropic Guccione's constitutive law are successfully identified for both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. We conclude that the four parameters in Guccione's law can be uniquely and correctly determined in-silico from noisy displacement measurements of material points located on the myocardial surfaces. The future application of this novel and effective approach to real clinical measurements is thus promising.},

When compensatory responses are not sustainable, cardiac dysfunction occurs, leading to cardiomyopathy. The many forms of cardiomyopathy exhibit a set of overlapping phenotypes reflecting the limited range of compensatory responses that the heart can use. These include cardiac hypertrophy, induction of genes normally expressed during development, fibrotic deposits that replace necrotic and apoptotic cardiomyocytes, and metabolic disturbances. The compensatory responses are mediated by signaling pathways that initially serve to maintain normal contractility; however, persistent activation of these pathways leads to cardiac dysfunction. Current research focuses on ways to target these specific pathways therapeutically.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The three-dimensional arrangement of the ventricular myocardial architecture remains controversial, in part because histological assessment is difficult to achieve, while anatomic dissections are, of necessity, destructive. In this study, we describe how the use of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging has permitted us to reconstruct with precision the architecture of the ventricular myocardial fibres in the post-mortem swine heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained diffusion-weighted spin-echo measurements of autopsied porcine hearts using a whole body MR system. We calculated the diffusion tensor and the corresponding eigenvectors on a voxel-by-voxel basis. This permitted us to colour code the fibres, and reconstruct them by connecting voxels in direction of the largest eigenvector. Such reconstructions show that, in the middle layer of the left ventricle, most of the fibres have a circular orientation, albeit that a far from negligible component runs in a transverse direction. With increasing distance from the epicardium, the orientation of the fibres shows a continuous change in angulation with respect to an axis normal to the epicardium. CONCLUSION: Our data presented here supports the concept that the ventricular mass is arranged as a complex three-dimensional mesh of tangential and intruding fibres. The data offers no support for the concept of a "unique myocardial band". The method has the potential to detecting deviations from this basic normal architecture, being capable of reconstructing the ventricular mass so as to assess the spatial coordinates of any single fibre strand. The technique, therefore, has major potential clinical applications in the setting of the failing or malformed heart, potentially being able to identify either systematic or regional disarray of the myocardial fibres.},

  abstract = {Adult cardiac muscle adapts to mechanical changes in the environment by growth and remodeling (G\&R) via a variety of mechanisms. Hypertrophy develops when the heart is subjected to chronic mechanical overload. In ventricular pressure overload (e.g. due to aortic stenosis) the heart typically reacts by concentric hypertrophic growth, characterized by wall thickening due to myocyte radial growth when sarcomeres are added in parallel. In ventricular volume overload, an increase in filling pressure (e.g. due to mitral regurgitation) leads to eccentric hypertrophy as myocytes grow axially by adding sarcomeres in series leading to ventricular cavity enlargement that is typically accompanied by some wall thickening. The specific biomechanical stimuli that stimulate different modes of ventricular hypertrophy are still poorly understood. In a recent study, based on in-vitro studies in micropatterned myocyte cell cultures subjected to stretch, we proposed that cardiac myocytes grow longer to maintain a preferred sarcomere length in response to increased fiber strain and grow thicker to maintain interfilament lattice spacing in response to increased cross-fiber strain. Here, we test whether this growth law is able to predict concentric and eccentric hypertrophy in response to aortic stenosis and mitral valve regurgitation, respectively, in a computational model of the adult canine heart coupled to a closed loop model of circulatory hemodynamics. A non-linear finite element model of the beating canine ventricles coupled to the circulation was used. After inducing valve alterations, the ventricles were allowed to adapt in shape in response to mechanical stimuli over time. The proposed growth law was able to reproduce major acute and chronic physiological responses (structural and functional) when integrated with comprehensive models of the pressure-overloaded and volume-overloaded canine heart, coupled to a closed-loop circulation. We conclude that strain-based biomechanical stimuli can drive cardiac growth, including wall thickening during pressure overload.},

The discussion is limited to the simple case of the elastic behaviour and the rate independent damaging processes in brittle materials like concrete, that can be considered as initially isotropic. This case is important in order to focus on the true difficulties and to solve them. A recently proposed unilateral damage condition is recalled, that preserves symmetry of the elastic operators and eliminates the possibility of discontinuous stress-strain responses, present in the previous theories. Moreover, a simple but general form of the damage rate equation is proposed, which has the potentiality to describe fairly well the development of the anisotropic damage, using a fourth-order damage tensor. Various specialized forms are discussed that are based on simple elastic solutions in solids containing distributed microcracks},

In the present study, we investigated the architecture of silicon carbide (SiC) scaffolds produced by this technique over a range of cooling rates and suspension characteristics to demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness for fabricating unidirectional porous bodies with controlled lamella thickness, porosity fraction and morphology. An array of microstructures was generated specifically to examine the role of the suspension solid load and cooling rate on the pore morphology and final ceramic fraction. With respect to the morphology of the pores, a transition from lamellar to dendritic structure was found to be triggered by an increase in cooling rate or in suspension concentration. Similarly, the freezing condition and suspension characteristics were seen to influence the transition between particle rejection and entrapment by the ice. Based on this study, the specific processing parameters that result in distinct scaffold morphologies, namely lamellar, dendritic or isotropic morphology (the latter corresponding to particle entrapment), are identified and presented in the form of a ``morphology map'' to establish the regions of the different architectures of freeze-cast SiC scaffolds.},

The paper is aimed at assessing the approach and its potential application to various composite systems containing brittle constituents, such as polymer matrix composites or multi-layers. Expressions for fragments and fibers failures involve various random variables. The influence of the random variables on tensile stress\textendash{}strain behaviour predictions was investigated. Fragment strength\textendash{}size relationships were established using tensile tests performed on C/SiC minicomposites in the chamber of a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Experimental data and predictions validated the approach. Important implications for the prediction of multiple cracking and resulting stress\textendash{}strain behaviour are discussed.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To determine the inter-study reproducibility of MR feature tracking (MR-FT) derived left ventricular (LV) torsion and torsion rates for a combined assessment of systolic and diastolic myocardial function. METHODS: Steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine LV short-axis stacks were acquired at 9:00 (Exam A), 9:30 (Exam B), and 14:00 (Exam C) in 16 healthy volunteers at 3 Tesla. SSFP images were analyzed offline using MR-FT to assess rotational displacement in apical and basal slices. Global peak torsion, peak systolic and peak diastolic torsion rates were calculated using different definitions ("twist", "normalized twist" and "circumferential-longitudinal (CL) shear angle"). Exam A and B were compared to assess the inter-study reproducibility. Morning and afternoon scans were compared to address possible diurnal variation. RESULTS: The different methods showed good inter-study reproducibility for global peak torsion (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.90-0.92; coefficient of variation [CoV]: 19.0-20.3\%) and global peak systolic torsion rate (ICC: 0.82-0.84; CoV: 25.9-29.0\%). Conversely, global peak diastolic torsion rate showed little inter-study reproducibility (ICC: 0.34-0.47; CoV: 40.8-45.5\%). Global peak torsion as determined by the CL shear angle showed the best inter-study reproducibility (ICC: 0.90;CoV: 19.0\%). MR-FT results were not measurably affected by diurnal variation between morning and afternoon scans (CL shear angle: 4.8 $\pm$ 1.4$^\circ$, 4.8 $\pm$ 1.5$^\circ$, and 4.1 $\pm$ 1.6$^\circ$ for Exam A, B, and C, respectively; P = 0.21). CONCLUSION: MR-FT based derivation of myocardial peak torsion and peak systolic torsion rate has high inter-study reproducibility as opposed to peak diastolic torsion rate. The CL shear angle was the most reproducible parameter independently of cardiac anatomy and may develop into a robust tool to quantify cardiac rotational mechanics in longitudinal MR-FT patient studies.

  volume = {32},
  abstract = {The use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for studying the human heart in vivo is very challenging due to cardiac motion. This paper assesses the effects of cardiac motion on the human myocardial fiber architecture. To this end, a model for analyzing the effects of cardiac motion on signal intensity is presented. A Monte-Carlo simulation based on polarized light imaging data is then performed to calculate the diffusion signals obtained by the displacement of water molecules, which generate diffusion weighted (DW) images. Rician noise and in vivo motion data obtained from DENSE acquisition are added to the simulated cardiac DW images to produce motion-induced datasets. An algorithm based on principal components analysis filtering and temporal maximum intensity projection (PCATMIP) is used to compensate for motion-induced signal loss. Diffusion tensor parameters derived from motion-reduced DW images are compared to those derived from the original simulated DW images. Finally, to assess cardiac motion effects on in vivo fiber architecture, in vivo cardiac DTI data processed by PCATMIP are compared to those obtained from one trigger delay (TD) or one single phase acquisition. The results showed that cardiac motion produced overestimated fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity as well as a narrower range of fiber angles. The combined use of shifted TD acquisitions and postprocessing based on image registration and PCATMIP effectively improved the quality of in vivo DW images and subsequently, the measurement accuracy of fiber architecture properties. This suggests new solutions to the problems associated with obtaining in vivo human myocardial fiber architecture properties in clinical conditions.},

These models were developed using geometry reconstructed from magnetic resonance (MR) images, and constitutive descriptors of passive and active mechanics in cardiac tissues. Model parameter values associated with ventricular mechanical properties and myofiber architecture were obtained by fitting the models with measured pressure\textendash{}volume loops and circumferential strain calculated from MR images using a hyperelastic warping method. Results show that the peak right ventricle (RV) pressure was substantially higher in the PAH patient (65 mmHg versus 20 mmHg), who also has a significantly reduced ejection fraction (EF) in both ventricles (left ventricle (LV): 39\% versus 66\% and RV: 18\% versus 64\%). Peak systolic circumferential strain was comparatively lower in both the left ventricle (LV) and RV free wall (RVFW) of the PAH patient (LV: -6.8\% versus -13.2\% and RVFW: -2.1\% versus -9.4\%). Passive stiffness, contractility, and myofiber stress in the PAH patient were all found to be substantially increased in both ventricles, whereas septum wall in the PAH patient possessed a smaller curvature than that in the LV free wall. Simulations using the PAH model revealed an approximately linear relationship between the septum curvature and the transseptal pressure gradient at both early-diastole and end-systole. These findings suggest that PAH can induce LV remodeling, and septum curvature measurements may be useful in quantifying transseptal pressure gradient in PAH patients.},

  abstract = {T1 mapping is now a clinically feasible method, providing pixel-wise quantification of the cardiac structure's T1 values. Beyond focal lesions, well depicted by late gadolinium enhancement sequences, it has become possible to discriminate diffuse myocardial alterations, previously not assessable by noninvasive means. The strength of this method includes the high reproducibility and immediate clinical applicability, even without the use of contrast media injection (native or pre-contrast T1). The two most important determinants of native T1 augmentation are (1) edema related to tissue water increase (recent infarction or inflammation) and (2) interstitial space increase related to fibrosis (infarction scar, cardiomyopathy) or to amyloidosis. Conversely, lipid (Anderson-Fabry) or iron overload diseases are responsible for T1 reduction. In this pictorial review, the main features provided by native T1 mapping are discussed and illustrated, with a special focus on the awaited clinical purpose of this unique, promising new method.},

  abstract = {The role of macropore size ($\backslash$textgreater100 microm) and geometry in synthetic scaffolds for bone regeneration has been studied extensively, but successful translation to the clinic has been slow. Significantly less attention has been given to porosity at the microscale (0.5-10 microm). While some have shown that microporosity in calcium phosphate (CaP)-based scaffolds can improve rate and extent of bone formation in macropores, none has explored microporosity as an additional and important space for bone ingrowth. Here we show osteointegration of biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) scaffolds at both the macro and micro length scales. Bone, osteoid, and osteogenic cells fill micropores in scaffold rods and osteocytes are embedded in mineralized matrix in micropores, without the addition of growth factors. This work further highlights the importance of considering design parameters at the microscale and demonstrates the possibility for a bone-scaffold composite with no "dead space." Embedded osteocytes distributed throughout microporous rods may form a mechanosensory network, which would not be possible in scaffolds without microporosity. Multiscale osteointegration has the potential to greatly improve overall performance of these scaffolds through an improvement of mechanical properties, load transfer, and stability in the long and short term, and represents a new paradigm for scaffold design.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of a novel percutaneous left ventricular partitioning device (VPD) in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) and a prior anterior myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND: Anterior myocardial infarction is frequently followed by left ventricular remodeling, HF, and increased long-term morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients were enrolled in a multinational, nonrandomized, longitudinal investigation. The primary end point was an assessment of safety, defined as the successful delivery and deployment of the VPD and absence of device-related major adverse cardiac events over 6 months. Secondary (exploratory) efficacy end points included changes in hemodynamics and functional status and were assessed serially throughout the study. RESULTS: Ventricular partitioning device placement was not attempted in 5 (13\%) of 39 subjects. The device was safely and successfully implanted in 31 (91\%) of the remaining 34 patients or 79\% of all enrolled patients. The 6-month rate of device-related major adverse cardiac event occurred in 5 (13\%) of 39 enrolled subjects and 5 (15\%) of 34 treated subjects, with 1 additional event occurring between 6 and 12 months. For patients discharged with the device to 12 months (n = 28), New York Heart Association class (2.5 $\pm$ 0.6 to 1.3 $\pm$ 0.6, P $\backslash$textless .001) and quality-of-life scores (38.6 $\pm$ 6.1 to 28.4 $\pm$ 4.4, P $\backslash$textless .002) improved significantly; however, the 6-minute hall walk distance (358.5 $\pm$ 20.4 m to 374.7 $\pm$ 25.6 m, P nonsignificant) only trended toward improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The left VPD appears to be relatively safe and potentially effective in the treatment for patients with HF and a prior anterior myocardial infarction. However, these limited results suggest the need for further evaluation in a larger randomized controlled trial.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional model of anisotropic damage by mesocrack growth is first described in its basic version, employing a second-order tensorial damage variable. The model-concerning rate-independent, small strain, isothermal behaviour-allows to take into account residual effects due to damage and reduces any system of mesocracks to three equivalent orthogonal sets. This first version is then extended to account for elastic moduli recovery due to crack closure. Micromechanical considerations impose to employ a fourth-order crack-related tensor when the mesocracks are constrained against opening. Unlike some models which do not avoid (or rectify a posteriori) discontinuities of the stress-strain response, the approach herein ensures a priori the stress continuity and allows to express a convenient macroscopic opening-closure criterion. Nevertheless, the new formulation maintains the orthotropy of the effective properties (instead of an eventual, more general form of anisotropy). Finally, it appears that the extended version does not introduce additional material constants compared to the basic version. The model is tested by simulating the behaviour of Fontainebleau sandstone},

  issn = {1742-5689},
  doi = {10.1098/rsif.2005.0073},
  abstract = {Constitutive relations are fundamental to the solution of problems in continuum mechanics, and are required in the study of, for example, mechanically dominated clinical interventions involving soft biological tissues. Structural continuum constitutive models of arterial layers integrate information about the tissue morphology and therefore allow investigation of the interrelation between structure and function in response to mechanical loading. Collagen fibres are key ingredients in the structure of arteries. In the media (the middle layer of the artery wall) they are arranged in two helically distributed families with a small pitch and very little dispersion in their orientation (i.e. they are aligned quite close to the circumferential direction). By contrast, in the adventitial and intimal layers, the orientation of the collagen fibres is dispersed, as shown by polarized light microscopy of stained arterial tissue. As a result, continuum models that do not account for the dispersion are not able to capture accurately the stress-strain response of these layers. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to develop a structural continuum framework that is able to represent the dispersion of the collagen fibre orientation. This then allows the development of a new hyperelastic free-energy function that is particularly suited for representing the anisotropic elastic properties of adventitial and intimal layers of arterial walls, and is a generalization of the fibre-reinforced structural model introduced by Holzapfel \& Gasser (Holzapfel \& Gasser 2001 Comput. Meth. Appl. Mech. Eng. 190, 4379-4403) and Holzapfel et al. (Holzapfel et al. 2000 J. Elast. 61, 1-48). The model incorporates an additional scalar structure parameter that characterizes the dispersed collagen orientation. An efficient finite element implementation of the model is then presented and numerical examples show that the dispersion of the orientation of collagen fibres in the adventitia of human iliac arteries has a significant effect on their mechanical response.},

The motivation is twofold: (1) to provide an automatic tool for personalizing the characteristics of a cardiac model in order to achieve predictivity in patient-specific modeling and (2) to obtain some useful information for diagnosis purposes in the estimated quantities themselves. In order to assess the global methodology, we specifically devised an animal experiment in which a controlled infarct was produced and data acquired before and after infarction, with an estimation of regional tissue contractility-a key parameter directly affected by the pathology-performed for every measured stage. After performing a preliminary assessment of our proposed methodology using synthetic data, we then demonstrate a full-scale application by first estimating contractility values associated with 6 regions based on the AHA subdivision, before running a more detailed estimation using the actual AHA segments. The estimation results are assessed by comparison with the medical knowledge of the specific infarct, and with late enhancement MR images. We discuss their accuracy at the various subdivision levels, in the light of the inherent modeling limitations and of the intrinsic information contents featured in the data.},

  volume = {113},
  issn = {0148-0731},
  abstract = {The equatorial region of the canine left ventricle was modeled as a thick-walled cylinder consisting of an incompressible hyperelastic material with homogeneous exponential properties. The anisotropic properties of the passive myocardium were assumed to be locally transversely isotropic with respect to a fiber axis whose orientation varied linearly across the wall. Simultaneous inflation, extension, and torsion were applied to the cylinder to produce epicardial strains that were measured previously in the potassium-arrested dog heart. Residual stress in the unloaded state was included by considering the stress-free configuration to be a warped cylindrical arc. In the special case of isotropic material properties, torsion and residual stress both significantly reduced the high circumferential stress peaks predicted at the endocardium by previous models. However, a resultant axial force and moment were necessary to cause the observed epicardial deformations. Therefore, the anisotropic material parameters were found that minimized these resultants and allowed the prescribed displacements to occur subject to the known ventricular pressure loads. The global minimum solution of this parameter optimization problem indicated that the stiffness of passive myocardium (defined for a 20 percent equibiaxial extension) would be 2.4 to 6.6 times greater in the fiber direction than in the transverse plane for a broad range of assumed fiber angle distributions and residual stresses. This agrees with the results of biaxial tissue testing. The predicted transmural distributions of fiber stress were relatively flat with slight peaks in the subepicardium, and the fiber strain profiles agreed closely with experimentally observed sarcomere length distributions. The results indicate that torsion, residual stress and material anisotropy associated with the fiber architecture all can act to reduce endocardial stress gradients in the passive left ventricle.},

Complex MF behaviors are difficult to model because spatial interactions cannot be directly implemented as ordinary differential equations. We therefore allow phenomenological approximations with careful consideration to the relationships with the underlying biophysical mechanisms. We describe new formulations that avoid mean-field approximations found in most existing MF models. To increase the scope and applicability of the model, we include length- and temperature-dependent effects that play important roles in MF responses. We have also included a representation of passive restoring forces to simulate isolated cell shortening protocols. Possessing both computational efficiency and the ability to simulate a wide variety of muscle responses, the MF representation is well suited for coupling to existing cardiac cell models of electrophysiology and Ca-handling mechanisms. To illustrate this suitability, the MF model is coupled to the Chicago rabbit cardiomyocyte model. The combined model generates realistic appearing action potentials, intracellular Ca transients, and cell shortening signals. The combined model also demonstrates that the feedback effects of force on Ca binding to troponin can modify the cytosolic Ca transient.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Images were obtained in 44 patients with normal LV function (NL, N=14), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, N=15) or ischemic heart disease (IHD, N=15). Local surface curvedness, normalized to take into account instantaneous LV size (C(n)), was calculated throughout the cardiac cycle and compared between segment groups: NL (N=401), IHD (N=92) and DCM (N=255). RESULTS: In all normal segments, C(n) gradually increased during systole and then decreased during diastole. While both maximum and minimum values of C(n) were comparable in the basal and midventricular segments, they were significantly higher in the four apical segments and highest in the apical cap. In addition, percent change in C(n) was higher in mid and apical compared to basal segments (P$\backslash$textless.05). At all LV levels, C(n) values in DCM segments were lower (P$\backslash$textless.05) than in NL and IHD segments, which were similar. In contrast, percent change in C(n) was significantly lower in both IHD and DCM segments compared to NL. CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional analysis of LV endocardial curvature yielded quantitative information on regional ventricular shape consistent with the known pathophysiology, supporting its potential clinical usefulness in the evaluation of LV remodeling.},

  abstract = {Deformation and structure of the cardiac wall can be assessed non-invasively by imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging. Understanding the (patho-)physiology that underlies the observed deformation and structure is critical for clinical diagnosis. However, much about the genesis of deformation and structure is unknown. In the present computational model study, we hypothesize that myofibers locally adapt their orientation to achieve minimal fiber-cross fiber shear strain during the cardiac cycle. This hypothesis was tested in a 3D finite element model of left ventricular (LV) mechanics by computation of tissue deformations and subsequent adaptation of initial myofiber orientations towards those in the deformed tissue. As a consequence of adaptation, local tissue peak stress, strain during ejection and stroke work density were all found to increase by at least 10\%, as well as to become 50\% more homogeneous throughout the wall. Global LV work (peak systolic pressure, stroke volume and stroke work) increased significantly as well ($\backslash$textgreater9\%). The model-predicted myofiber orientations were found to be similar to those in experiments. To the best of our knowledge the presented model is the first that is able to simultaneously predict a realistic myocardial structure as well as to account for the experimentally observed homogeneity in local mechanics. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  volume = {22},
  abstract = {Delamination is a phenomenon which involves complex degradations of layers and interlaminar connections. In order to take these degradations into account, a laminate is modelled as a stacking sequence of homogeneous layers and interlaminar interfaces. The aim of this article is to focus on the interface modelling and first identification. The interface is a three-dimensional medium the thickness of which is negligible compared to the in-plane dimensions. Therefore it can be modelled as a two-dimensional entity which ensures displacement and traction transfer from one ply to another. The interface depends on the angle between the fibre directions of two adjacent layers. In the first instance it is assumed to be elastic and damageable. The main interest of this model is that, using only a few intrinsic characteristics of the interface, it is possible to predict the tendency of a structure to delaminate. One of the main difficulties is to identify these characteristics. This approach allows a clear connection between fracture mechanics and damage mechanics. This modelling has been used for the predicting of delamination initiation and growth in the case of static loadings without buckling.},

  abstract = {Technological limitations pose a major challenge to acquisition of myocardial fiber orientations for patient-specific modeling of cardiac (dys)function and assessment of therapy. The objective of this project was to develop a methodology to estimate cardiac fiber orientations from in vivo images of patient heart geometries. An accurate representation of ventricular geometry and fiber orientations was reconstructed, respectively, from high-resolution ex vivo structural magnetic resonance (MR) and diffusion tensor (DT) MR images of a normal human heart, referred to as the atlas. Ventricular geometry of a patient heart was extracted, via semiautomatic segmentation, from an in vivo computed tomography (CT) image. Using image transformation algorithms, the atlas ventricular geometry was deformed to match that of the patient. Finally, the deformation field was applied to the atlas fiber orientations to obtain an estimate of patient fiber orientations. The accuracy of the fiber estimates was assessed using six normal and three failing canine hearts. The mean absolute difference between inclination angles of acquired and estimated fiber orientations was 15.4 degrees . Computational simulations of ventricular activation maps and pseudo-ECGs in sinus rhythm and ventricular tachycardia indicated that there are no significant differences between estimated and acquired fiber orientations at a clinically observable level.},

  abstract = {In the multidisciplinary field of heart research it is of utmost importance to identify accurate myocardium material properties for the description of phenomena such as mechano-electric feedback or heart wall thickening. A rationally-based material model is required to understand the highly nonlinear mechanics of complex structures such as the passive myocardium under different loading conditions. Unfortunately, to date there are no experimental data of human heart tissues available to estimate material parameters and to develop adequate material models. This study aimed to determine biaxial extension and triaxial shear properties and the underlying microstructure of the passive human ventricular myocardium. Using new state-of-the-art equipment, planar biaxial extension tests were performed to determine the biaxial extension properties of the passive ventricular human myocardium. Shear properties of the myocardium were examined by triaxial simple shear tests performed on small cubic specimens excised from an adjacent region of the biaxial extension specimens. The three-dimensional microstructure was investigated through second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy on optically cleared tissues, which emphasized the 3D orientation and dispersion of the myofibers and adjacent collagen fabrics. The results suggest that the passive human LV myocardium under quasi-static and dynamic multiaxial loadings is a nonlinear, anisotropic (orthotropic), viscoelastic and history-dependent soft biological material undergoing large deformations. Material properties of the tissue components along local microstructural axes drive the nonlinear and orthotropic features of the myocardium. SHG microscopy investigation revealed detailed information about the myocardial microstructure due to its high resolution. It enabled the identification of structural parameters such as the fiber and the sheet orientations and corresponding dispersions. With this complete set of material data, a sophisticated material model and associated material parameters can be defined for a better description of the biomechanical response of the ventricular myocardium in humans. Such a model will lead to more accurate computational simulations to better understand the fundamental underlying ventricular mechanics, a step needed in the improvement of medical treatment of heart diseases.},

The method presented in this work combines B-spline interpolation and Green's theorem to provide optimized quantification of blood flow and vessel wall parameters. The B-spline model provided optimal derivatives of the measured three-directional blood velocities onto the vessel contour, as required for vectorial wall shear stress (WSS) computation. Eight planes distributed along the entire thoracic aorta were evaluated in a 19-volunteer study using both high-spatiotemporal-resolution planar two-dimensional (2D)-CINE-PC ( approximately 1.4 x 1.4 mm(2)/24.4 ms) and lower-resolution 3D-CINE-PC ( approximately 2.8 x 1.6 x 3 mm(3)/48.6 ms) with three-directional velocity encoding. Synthetic data, error propagation, and interindividual, intermodality, and interobserver variability were used to evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of the method. While the impact of MR measurement noise was only minor, the limited resolution of PC-MRI introduced systematic WSS underestimations. In vivo data demonstrated close agreement for flow and WSS between 2D- and 3D-CINE-PC as well as observers, and confirmed the reliability of the method. WSS analysis along the aorta revealed the presence of a circumferential WSS component accounting for 10-20\%. Initial results in a patient with atherosclerosis suggest the potential of the method for understanding the formation and progression of cardiovascular diseases.},

  abstract = {Tagged MRI and finite-element (FE) analysis are valuable tools in analyzing cardiac mechanics. To determine systolic material parameters in three-dimensional stress-strain relationships, we used tagged MRI to validate FE models of left ventricular (LV) aneurysm. Five sheep underwent anteroapical myocardial infarction (25\% of LV mass) and 22 wk later underwent tagged MRI. Asymmetric FE models of the LV were formed to in vivo geometry from MRI and included aneurysm material properties measured with biaxial stretching, LV pressure measurements, and myofiber helix angles measured with diffusion tensor MRI. Systolic material parameters were determined that enabled FE models to reproduce midwall, systolic myocardial strains from tagged MRI (630 +/- 187 strain comparisons/animal). When contractile stress equal to 40\% of the myofiber stress was added transverse to the muscle fiber, myocardial strain agreement improved by 27\% between FE model predictions and experimental measurements (RMS error decreased from 0.074 +/- 0.016 to 0.054 +/- 0.011, P $\backslash$textless 0.05). In infarct border zone (BZ), end-systolic midwall stress was elevated in both fiber (24.2 +/- 2.7 to 29.9 +/- 2.4 kPa, P $\backslash$textless 0.01) and cross-fiber (5.5 +/- 0.7 to 11.7 +/- 1.3 kPa, P = 0.02) directions relative to noninfarct regions. Contrary to previous hypotheses but consistent with biaxial stretching experiments, active cross-fiber stress development is an integral part of LV systole; FE analysis with only uniaxial contracting stress is insufficient. Stress calculations from these validated models show 24\% increase in fiber stress and 115\% increase in cross-fiber stress at the BZ relative to remote regions, which may contribute to LV remodeling.},

  abstract = {Skin is a highly dynamic, autoregulated, living system that responds to mechanical stretch through a net gain in skin surface area. Tissue expansion uses the concept of controlled overstretch to grow extra skin for defect repair in situ. While the short-term mechanics of stretched skin have been studied intensely by testing explanted tissue samples ex vivo, we know very little about the long-term biomechanics and mechanobiology of living skin in vivo. Here we explore the long-term effects of mechanical stretch on the characteristics of living skin using a mathematical model for skin growth. We review the molecular mechanisms by which skin responds to mechanical loading and model their effects collectively in a single scalar-valued internal variable, the surface area growth. This allows us to adopt a continuum model for growing skin based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into a reversible elastic and an irreversible growth part. To demonstrate the inherent modularity of this approach, we implement growth as a user-defined constitutive subroutine into the general purpose implicit finite element program Abaqus/Standard. To illustrate the features of the model, we simulate the controlled area growth of skin in response to tissue expansion with multiple filling points in time. Our results demonstrate that the field theories of continuum mechanics can reliably predict the manipulation of thin biological membranes through mechanical overstretch. Our model could serve as a valuable tool to rationalize clinical process parameters such as expander geometry, expander size, filling volume, filling pressure, and inflation timing to minimize tissue necrosis and maximize patient comfort in plastic and reconstructive surgery. While initially developed for growing skin, our model can easily be generalized to arbitrary biological structures to explore the physiology and pathology of stretch-induced growth of other living systems such as hearts, arteries, bladders, intestines, ureters, muscles, and nerves. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In multiscale analysis of components, there is usually a need to solve microstructures with complex geometries. In this paper, we use the extended finite element method (X-FEM) to solve scales involving complex geometries. The X-FEM allows one to use meshes not necessarily matching the physical surface of the problem while retaining the accuracy of the classical finite element approach. For material interfaces, this is achieved by introducing a new enrichment strategy. Although the mesh does not need to conform to the physical surfaces, it needs to be fine enough to capture the geometry of these surfaces. A simple algorithm is described to adaptively refine the mesh to meet this geometrical requirement. Numerical experiments on the periodic homogenization of two-phase complex cells demonstrate the accuracy and simplicity of the X-FEM.},

Porous structures consisting of a tetragonal three-dimensional mesh of interpenetrating rods were fabricated from concentrated TCP inks with suitable viscoelastic properties. Biodegradable polymers (polylactic acid (PLA) and poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL)) were infiltrated into selected scaffolds by immersion of the structure in a polymer melt. Infiltration increased the uniaxial compressive strength of these model scaffolds by a factor of three (PCL) or six (PLA). It also considerably improved the mechanical integrity of the structures after initial cracking, with the infiltrated structure retaining a significant load-bearing capacity after fracture of the ceramic rods. The strength improvement in the infiltrated scaffolds was attributed to two different contributions: the sealing of precursor flaws in the ceramic rod surfaces and the partial transfer of stress to the polymer, as confirmed by finite element analysis. The implications of these results for the mechanical optimization of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications are discussed.},

It is crucial to better understand the progression of adverse remodeling, in order to develop effective treatment. In addition, being able to assess changes in vivo would be a powerful tool in the clinic. The goal of the current study is to quantify the in vivo material properties of infarcted and remote myocardium 1 week after MI, as well as the orientation of collagen fibers in the infarct. This will be accomplished by using a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), catheterization, finite element modeling, and numerical optimization to analyze a porcine model ([Formula: see text]) of posterolateral myocardial infarction. Specifically, properties will be determined by minimizing the difference between in vivo strains and volume calculated from MRI and finite element model predicted strains and volume. The results indicate that the infarct region is stiffer than the remote region and that the infarct collagen fibers become more circumferentially oriented 1 week post-MI. These findings are consistent with previous studies, which employed ex vivo techniques. The proposed methodology will ultimately provide a means of predicting remote and infarct mechanical properties in vivo at any time point post-MI.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the hemodynamic characteristics inside a physiologically correct three-dimensional LV model using fluid structure interaction scheme are examined under various heart beat conditions during early filling wave (E-wave), diastasis and atrial contraction wave (A-wave). The time dependent and incompressible viscous fluid, nonlinear viscous fluid and the stress tensor equations are coupled with the full Navier-Stoke's equations together with the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian and elasticity in the solid domain are used in the analysis. The results are discussed in terms of the variation in the intraventricular pressure, wall shear stress (WSS) and the fluid flow patterns inside the LV model. Moreover, changes in the magnitude of displacements on the LV are also observed during diastole period. The results obtained demonstrate that the magnitude of the intraventricle pressure is found higher in the basal region of the LV during the beginning of the E-wave and A-wave, whereas the Ip is found much higher in the apical region when the flow propagation is in peak E-wave, peak A-wave and diastasis. The magnitude of the pressure is found to be 5.4E2 Pa during the peak E-wave. Additionally, WSS elevates with the rise in the E-wave and A-wave but the magnitude decreases during the diastasis phase. During the peak E-wave, maximum WSS is found to be 5.7 Pa. Subsequent developments, merging and shifting of the vortices are observed throughout the filling wave. Formations of clockwise vortices are evident during the peak E-wave and at the onset of the A-wave, but counter clockwise vortices are found at the end of the diastasis and at the beginning of the A-wave. Moreover, the maximum magnitude of the structural displacement is seen in the ventricle apex with the value of 3.7E-5 m.},

  abstract = {A tensor-based method is proposed for the solution of partial differential equations defined on uncertain parameterized domains. It provides an accurate solution which is explicit with respect to parameters defining the shape of the domain, thus allowing efficient a posteriori probabilistic or parametric analyses. In the proposed method, a fictitious domain approach is first adopted for the reformulation of the parametric problem on a fixed domain, yielding a weak formulation in a tensor product space (product of space functions and parametric functions). The paper is limited to the case of Neumann conditions on uncertain parts of the boundary. The Proper Generalized Decomposition method is then introduced for the construction of a tensor product approximation (separated representation) of the solution. It can be seen as an a priori model reduction technique which automatically captures reduced bases of space functions and parametric functions which are optimal for the representation of the solution. This tensor-based method is made computationally tractable by introducing separated representations of variational forms, resulting from separated representations of the parameterized indicator function of the uncertain domain. For this purpose, a method is proposed for the construction of a constrained tensor product approximation which preserves positivity and therefore ensures well-posedness of problems associated with approximate indicator functions. Moreover, a regularization of the geometry is introduced to speed up the convergence of these tensor product approximations.},

  abstract = {Multidimensional blood flow imaging with magnetic resonance has rapidly evolved over the last decade. The technique, often referred to as 4-dimensional (4D) flow, can now reliably image the heart and principal vessels of the chest in $\leq$15 minutes. In addition to dynamic 3D flow visualization, a range of unique quantitative hemodynamic markers can be calculated from 4D flow data. In this review article, we describe some of the more promising of these hemodynamic markers, including pulse wave velocity, pressure, turbulent kinetic energy, wall shear stress, and flow eccentricity. Evaluation of a range of cardiothoracic disorders has been explored with 4D flow, and many applications have been proposed. We also review the potential clinical applications of 4D flow in 4 broad contexts: the aorta, the pulmonary artery, acquired heart disease, and complex congenital heart disease. Promising preliminary results will be highlighted, including the use of abnormal systolic blood flow to risk-stratify patients for progressive valve-related aortic disease, turbulent kinetic energy to directly assess the hemodynamic impact of a stenotic lesion, and altered intracardiac flow to identify early heart failure. We discuss ongoing research efforts in the context of the larger clinical goals of 4D flow: the use of unique hemodynamic markers to (1) identify cardiovascular disease processes early in their course before clinical manifestation so that preemptive treatment can be undertaken; (2) refine the assessment of cardiovascular disease so as to better identify optimal medical or surgical therapies; and (3) enhance the evaluation and monitoring of the hemodynamic impact of different treatment options.},

Report 669, CPAM, University of California, Berkeley, 1996], crack propagation [M. Stolarska et al., Internat. J. Numer. Methods Engrg., 51 (2001), pp. 943\textendash{} 960; N. Sukumar, D. L.

It has also been a valuable tool for the implementation of modern level set methods where it is used to efficiently compute the distance to the front and/or an extended velocity function. In this paper, we improve upon the second order fast marching method of Sethian [SIAM Rev., 41 (1999), pp. 199\textendash{}235] by constructing a second order approximation of the interface generated from local data on the mesh. The data is interpolated on a single box of the mesh using a bicubic approximation. The distance to the front is then calculated by using a variant of Newton's method to solve both the level curve equation and the orthogonality condition for the nearest point to a given node. The result is a second order approximation of the distance to the interface which can then be used to produce second order accurate initial conditions for the fast marching method and a third order fast marching method.},

In particular, the shear behaviour is thought to play an important mechanical role due to the laminar architecture of myocardium. We have previously compared a number of myocardial constitutive relations with the aim to extract their suitability for inverse material parameter estimation. The previous study assumed a homogeneous deformation. In the present study we relaxed the homogeneous assumption by implementing these laws into a finite element environment in order to obtain more realistic measures for the suitability of these laws in both their ability to fit a given set of experimental data, as well as their stability in the finite element environment. In particular, we examined five constitutive laws and compare them on the basis of (i) "goodness of fit": how well they fit a set of six shear deformation tests, (ii) "determinability": how well determined the objective function is at the optimal parameter fit, and (iii) "variability": how well determined the material parameters are over the range of experiments. Furthermore, we compared the FE results with those from the previous study.It was found that the same material law as in the previous study, the orthotropic Fung-type "Costa-Law", was the most suitable for inverse material parameter estimation for myocardium in simple shear.},

  volume = {43},
  abstract = {ln a previous paper, a new model called the Binary Model was formulated to describe the behavior of textile composites with three-dimensional (3D) reinforcement. Here, detailed prescriptions are given for the constitutive laws of the computational elements in terms of the properties of the constituent materials and the geometry of the fiber reinforcement. The application studied is to woven composites with 3D interlock reinforcement. Predicted macroscopic elastic constants agree with experimental values without the use of adjustable parameters. The Binary Model also shows how the waviness of nominally straight tows in 3D weaves affects the statistics of local stresses. Through-thickness reinforcement also disorders local stresses, but its effect is found generally to be much less than that of tow waviness for current 3D woven composites. For predicting the onset of failure, it is inferred that treating the stochastic effects of tow irregularity is much more important than modeling the influence of local tow configurations in great detail.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the development of a generalized model of continuum damage mechanics for fatigue fracture. With the introduction of a new damage effect tensor, the necessary constitutive equations of elasticity and plasticity coupled with damage are for the first instance derived. This is followed by the formulations of fatigue damage dissipative potential function and a fatigue damage criterion which are required for the development of a fatigue damage evolution equation. The fatigue evolution model is based on the hypothesis that the overall fatigue damage is induced by the summation of `elastic' and `plastic' damages. The validity of the damage model proposed is verified by comparing the predicted and measured number of cycles to failure for ten tensile specimens each applied with different load ranges and excellent agreement has been achieved.},

  title = {Characterization of Patient-Specific Biventricular Mechanics in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction: {{Hyperelastic}} Warping},
  abstract = {Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is considered as a major public health problem. Traditionally, HFPEF is diagnosed based on a ``normal'' EF, but the studies have explored the potential role of left ventricular mechanics. Furthermore, right ventricular mechanics and bi-ventricular interaction in HFPEF is currently not well understood. In this study, we aim to develop a framework using a hyperelastic warping approach to quantify bi-ventricular and septum strains from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. Whole heart models were reconstructed in HFPEF, HF with reduced EF (HFREF) and normal control patients, and a Laplace-Dirichlet Rule-Based (LDRB) algorithm was employed to assign circumferential orientation. The LV circumferential strain was 10.56\% in normal control, and decreased to 5.90\% in HFPEF and 1.66\% in HFREF. Interestingly, the RV circumferential strain was 7.29\% in normal control, but increased to 8.93\% in HFPEF, and decreased to 2.16\% in HFREF. The septum circumferential strain was comparable between HFPEF and normal control. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction demonstrated augmented right ventricular strain and comparable septum strain to maintain its ``normal'' ejection fraction. This might unveil a new mechanism of bi-ventricular interaction and compensation in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Ventricular volume reduction surgery has been proposed by Batista to improve cardiac function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. However, limited clinical data exist to determine the efficacy of this operation. A finite element simulation is therefore used to determine the effect of volume reduction surgery on left ventricular end-systolic elastance, diastolic compliance, stroke work/end-diastolic volume (preload recruitable stroke work), and stroke work/end-diastolic pressure (Starling) relationships. Methods: End-diastole and end-systole were represented by elastic finite element models with different unloaded shapes and nonlinear material properties. End-systolic elastance, diastolic compliance, preload recruitable stroke work, and Starling relationships, as well as energy expenditure per gram of unresected myocardium, were calculated. Two different types of volume reduction surgery (apical and lateral) were simulated at 10\% and 20\% left ventricular mass reduction. Results: Ventricular volume reduction surgery causes diastolic compliance to shift further to the left on the pressure-volume diagram than end-systolic elastance. Volume reduction surgery increases the slope of the preload recruitable stroke work relationship (dilated cardiomyopathy 0.006 J/mL; 20\% lateral volume reduction surgery 0.009 J/mL) but decreases the slope of the Starling relationship (dilated cardiomyopathy 0.028 J/mm Hg; 20\% lateral volume reduction 0.023 J/mm Hg). For a given amount of resection, lateral volume reduction has a greater effect than apical volume reduction. Ten-percent and 20\% lateral volume reduction reduces energy expenditure by 7\% and 17\%, respectively. Conclusion: Ventricular volume reduction surgery shifts end-systolic elastance and diastolic compliance to the left on the pressure-volume diagram. The net effect on ventricular function is mixed. Volume reduction surgery increases the slope of preload recruitable stroke work, but increased diastolic compliance causes a small decrease in the Starling relationship (3 mm Hg difference between dilated cardiomyopathy and volume reduction surgery at stroke work = 0.5 J).},

  abstract = {The melting temperature of ice I(h) for several commonly used models of water (SPC, SPC/E,TIP3P,TIP4P, TIP4P/Ew, and TIP5P) is obtained from computer simulations at p = 1 bar. Since the melting temperature of ice I(h) for the TIP4P model is now known [E. Sanz, C. Vega, J. L. F. Abascal, and L. G. MacDowell, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 255701 (2004)], it is possible to use the Gibbs-Duhem methodology [D. Kofke, J. Chem. Phys. 98, 4149 (1993)] to evaluate the melting temperature of ice I(h) for other potential models of water. We have found that the melting temperatures of ice I(h) for SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ew, and TIP5P models are T = 190 K, 215 K, 146 K, 232 K, 245 K, and 274 K, respectively. The relative stability of ice I(h) with respect to ice II for these models has also been considered. It turns out that for SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, and TIP5P the stable phase at the normal melting point is ice II (so that ice I(h) is not a thermodynamically stable phase for these models). For TIP4P and TIP4P/Ew, ice I(h) is the stable solid phase at the standard melting point. The location of the negative charge along the H-O-H bisector appears as a critical factor in the determination of the relative stability between the I(h) and II ice forms. The methodology proposed in this paper can be used to investigate the effect upon a coexistence line due to a change in the potential parameters.},

We discuss some of the remaining challenges in developing reliable patient-specific models of cardiac electromechanical activity, and identify some of the main areas for focusing future research efforts. Key challenges include: efficiently generating accurate patient-specific geometric meshes and mapping regional myofiber architecture to them; modeling electrical activation patterns based on cellular alterations in human heart failure, and estimating regional tissue conductivities based on clinically available electrocardiographic recordings; estimating unloaded ventricular reference geometry and material properties for biomechanical simulations; and parameterizing systemic models of circulatory dynamics from available hemodynamic measurements. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Among patients without cardiac histology, LGE was present in 86\% of those with evidence of CA by echocardiography and in 47\% of those without evidence of CA by echocardiography. In patients without echocardiographic evidence of CA, the presence of LGE was associated with worse clinical, electrocardiographic (ECG), and cardiac biomarker profiles.

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0107159},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: In this work we present a dual-phase diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique that incorporates a correction scheme for the cardiac material strain, based on 3D myocardial tagging. METHODS: In vivo dual-phase cardiac DTI with a stimulated echo approach and 3D tagging was performed in 10 healthy volunteers. The time course of material strain was estimated from the tagging data and used to correct for strain effects in the diffusion weighted acquisition. Mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, helix, transverse and sheet angles were calculated and compared between systole and diastole, with and without strain correction. Data acquired at the systolic sweet spot, where the effects of strain are eliminated, served as a reference. RESULTS: The impact of strain correction on helix angle was small. However, large differences were observed in the transverse and sheet angle values, with and without strain correction. The standard deviation of systolic transverse angles was significantly reduced from 35.9$\pm$3.9$^\circ$ to 27.8$^\circ\pm$3.5$^\circ$ (p$\backslash$textless0.001) upon strain-correction indicating more coherent fiber tracks after correction. Myocyte aggregate structure was aligned more longitudinally in systole compared to diastole as reflected by an increased transmural range of helix angles (71.8$^\circ\pm$3.9$^\circ$ systole vs. 55.6$^\circ\pm$5.6$^\circ$, p$\backslash$textless0.001 diastole). While diastolic sheet angle histograms had dominant counts at high sheet angle values, systolic histograms showed lower sheet angle values indicating a reorientation of myocyte sheets during contraction. CONCLUSION: An approach for dual-phase cardiac DTI with correction for material strain has been successfully implemented. This technique allows assessing dynamic changes in myofiber architecture between systole and diastole, and emphasizes the need for strain correction when sheet architecture in the heart is imaged with a stimulated echo approach.},

  abstract = {Background\textemdash- Previous animal studies have demonstrated that the transmural extent of acute myocardial infarction defined by contrast-enhanced MRI (ceMRI) relates to early restoration of flow and future improvements in contractile function. We tested the hypothesis that ceMRI would have similar predictive value in humans. Methods and Results\textemdash- Twenty-four patients who presented with their first myocardial infarction and were successfully revascularized underwent cine and ceMRI of their heart within 7 days (scan 1) of the peak MB band of creatine kinase. Cine MRI was repeated 8 to 12 weeks later (scan 2). The transmural extent of infarction on scan 1 and wall thickening on both scans were determined using a 72-segment model. A total of 524 of 1571 segments (33\%) were dysfunctional on scan 1. Improvement in segmental contractile function on scan 2 was inversely related to the transmural extent of infarction on scan 1 (P=0.001). Improvement in global contractile function, as assessed by ejection fraction and mean wall thickening score, was not predicted by peak creatine kinase-MB (P=0.66) or by total infarct size, as defined by MRI (P=0.70). The best predictor of global improvement was the extent of dysfunctional myocardium that was not infarcted or had infarction comprising $\backslash$textless25\% of left ventricular wall thickness (P$\backslash$textless0.005 for ejection fraction, P$\backslash$textless0.001 for mean wall thickening score). Conclusion\textemdash- In patients with acute myocardial infarction, the transmural extent of infarction defined by ceMRI predicts improvement in contractile function.},

  abstract = {Heart wall myofibers wind as helices around the ventricles, strengthening them in a manner analogous to the reinforcement of concrete cylindrical columns by spiral steel cables [Richart FE, et al. (1929) Univ of Illinois, Eng Exp Stn Bull 190]. A multitude of such fibers, arranged smoothly and regularly, contract and relax as an integrated functional unit as the heart beats. To orchestrate this motion, fiber tangling must be avoided and pumping should be efficient. Current models of myofiber orientation across the heart wall suggest groupings into sheets or bands, but the precise geometry of bundles of myofibers is unknown. Here we show that this arrangement takes the form of a special minimal surface, the generalized helicoid [Blair DE, Vanstone JR (1978) Minimal Submanifolds and Geodesics 13-16], closing the gap between individual myofibers and their collective wall structure. The model holds across species, with a smooth variation in its three curvature parameters within the myocardial wall providing tight fits to diffusion magnetic resonance images from the rat, the dog, and the human. Mathematically it explains how myofibers are bundled in the heart wall while economizing fiber length and optimizing ventricular ejection volume as they contract. The generalized helicoid provides a unique foundation for analyzing the fibrous composite of the heart wall and should therefore find applications in heart tissue engineering and in the study of heart muscle diseases.},

  abstract = {The functional requirements for synthetic tissue substitutes appear deceptively simple: they should provide a porous matrix with interconnecting porosity and surface properties that promote rapid tissue ingrowth; at the same time, they should possess sufficient stiffness, strength and toughness to prevent crushing under physiological loads until full integration and healing are reached. Despite extensive efforts and first encouraging results, current biomaterials for tissue regeneration tend to suffer common limitations: insufficient tissue-material interaction and an inherent lack of strength and toughness associated with porosity. The challenge persists to synthesize materials that mimic both structure and mechanical performance of the natural tissue and permit strong tissue-implant interfaces to be formed. In the case of bone substitute materials, for example, the goal is to engineer high-performance composites with effective properties that, similar to natural mineralized tissue, exceed by orders of magnitude the properties of its constituents. It is still difficult with current technology to emulate in synthetic biomaterials multi-level hierarchical composite structures that are thought to be the origin of the observed mechanical property amplification in biological materials. Freeze casting permits to manufacture such complex, hybrid materials through excellent control of structural and mechanical properties. As a processing technique for the manufacture of biomaterials, freeze casting therefore has great promise.},

  abstract = {It is generally recognized that chronic left ventricular (LV) pressure overload results primarily in wall thickening and concentric hypertrophy, while chronic LV volume overload is characterized by chamber enlargement and an eccentric pattern of hypertrophy. To assess the potential role of the hemodynamic factors which might account for these different patterns of hypertrophy, we measured LV wall stresses throughout the cardiac cycle in 30 patients studied at the time of cardiac catheterization. The study group consisted of 6 subjects with LV pressure overload, 18 with LV volume overload, and 6 with no evidence of heart disease (control). LV pressure, meridional wall stress (sigman), wall thickness (h), and radius (R) were measured in each patient throughout the cardiac cycle. For patients with pressure overload, LV peak systolic and end diastolic pressures were significantly increased (220 plus or minus 6/23 plus or minus 3 mm Hg) compared to control (117 plus or minus 7/10 plus or minus 1 mm Hg, P less than 0.01 for each). However, peak systolic and end diastolic (sigman) were normal (161 plus or minus 24/23 plus or minus 3 times 10-3 dyn/cm-2) compared to control (151 plus or minus 14/17 plus or minus 2 times 10-3 dyn/cm-2, NS), reflecting the fact that the pressure overload was exactly counterbalanced by increased wall thickness (1.5 plus or minus 0.1 cm for pressure overload vs. 0.8 plus or minus 0.1 cm for control, P less than 0.01). For patients with volume overload, peak systolic (sigman) was not significantly different from control, but end diastolic (sigmam) was consistently higher than normal (41 plus or minus 3 times 10-3 dyn/cm-2 for volume overload, 17 plus or minus 2 times 10-3 dyn/cm-2 for control, P less than 0.01). LV pressure overload was associated with concentric hypertrophy, and an increased value for the ratio of wall thickness to radius (h/R ratio). In contrast, LV volume overload was associated with eccentric hypertrophy, and a normal h/R ratio. These data suggest the hypothesis that hypertrophy develops to normalize systolic but not diastolic wall stress. We propose that increased systolic tension development by myocardial fibers results in fiber thickening just sufficient to return the systolic stress (force per unit cross-sectional area) to normal. In contrast, increased resting or diastolic tension appears to result in gradual fiber elongation or lengthening which improves efficiency of the ventricular chamber but cannot normalize the diastolic wall stress.},

  abstract = {Numerous in-vitro studies have established that cells react to their physical environment and to applied mechanical loading. However, the mechanisms underlying such phenomena are poorly understood. Previous modelling of cell compression considered the cell as a passive homogenous material, requiring an artificial increase in the stiffness of spread cells to replicate experimentally measured forces. In this study, we implement a fully 3D active constitutive formulation that predicts the distribution, remodelling, and contractile behaviour of the cytoskeleton. Simulations reveal that polarised and axisymmetric spread cells contain stress fibres which form dominant bundles that are stretched during compression. These dominant fibres exert tension; causing an increase in computed compression forces compared to round cells. In contrast, fewer stress fibres are computed for round cells and a lower resistance to compression is predicted. The effect of different levels of cellular contractility associated with different cell phenotypes is also investigated. Highly contractile cells form more dominant circumferential stress fibres and hence provide greater resistance to compression. Computed predictions correlate strongly with published experimentally observed trends of compression resistance as a function of cellular contractility and offer an insight into the link between cell geometry, stress fibre distribution and contractility, and cell deformability. Importantly, it is possible to capture the behaviour of both round and spread cells using a given, unchanged set of material parameters for each cell type. Finally, it is demonstrated that stress distributions in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus computed using the active formulation differ significantly from those computed using passive material models.},

Then, this model is deformed to fit a clinical MRI, using a semi-automatic fuzzy segmentation, an affine registration method and a local deformable biomechanical model. An electromechanical model of the heart is then presented and simulated. Finally, a data assimilation procedure is described, and applied to this model. Data assimilation makes it possible to estimate local contractility from given displacements. Presented results on fitting to patient-specific anatomy and assimilation with simulated data are very promising. Current work on model calibration and estimation of patient parameters opens up possibilities to apply this framework in a clinical environment.},

Contraction is driven by a length-independent free calcium transient. The number of actin sites available to react with myosin is determined from the total number of actin sites (available and inhibited), free calcium and the length history-dependent association and dissociation rates of two Ca2+ ions and troponin as governed by a first-order, classical kinetics, differential equation. Finally, the relationship between active tension and the number of available actin sites is described by a general cross-bridge model. Bridges attach in a single configuration at a constant rate, the force within each cross-bridge varies linearly with position, and the rate constant of bridge detachment depends both on position and time after onset of contraction. In Part II, these constitutive relations for active stress are incorporated in a continuum mechanics model of the left ventricle that predicted end-systolic transmural strain distributions as observed experimentally.},

After determining the size of the critical defect, some correlations between the defect distribution and the Weibull's parameters are deduced from either Linear Fracture Mechanics or Continuum Damage Mechanics. The effect of the statistical distribution of defects within the material is computed and studied with respect to the distribution itself, the loaded volume of the structure and the heterogeneity of the stress field.},

  abstract = {Biological tissues have unique mechanical properties due to the wavy fibrous collagen and elastin microstructure. In inflation, a vessel easily distends under low pressure but becomes stiffer when the fibers are straightened to take up the load. The current microstructural models of blood vessels assume affine deformation; i.e., the deformation of each fiber is assumed to be identical to the macroscopic deformation of the tissue. This uniform-field (UF) assumption leads to the macroscopic (or effective) strain energy of the tissue that is the volumetric sum of the contributions of the tissue components. Here, a micromechanics-based constitutive model of fibrous tissue is developed to remove the affine assumption and to take into consideration the heterogeneous interactions between the fibers and the ground substance. The development is based on the framework of a recently developed second-order homogenization theory, and takes into account the waviness, orientations, and spatial distribution of the fibers, as well as the material nonlinearity at finite-strain deformation. In an illustrative simulation, the predictions of the macroscopic stress-strain relation, and the statistical deformation of the fibers are compared to the UF model, as well as finite-element (FE) simulation. Our predictions agree well with the FE results, while the UF predictions significantly overestimate. The effects of fiber distribution and waviness on the macroscopic stress-strain relation are also investigated. The present mathematical model may serves as a foundation for native as well as for engineered tissues and biomaterials.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To compare a steady-state free precession cine sequence-based technique (feature tracking [FT]) to tagged harmonic phase (HARP) analysis for peak average circumferential myocardial strain ($\epsilon$cc) analysis in a large and heterogeneous population of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Background: Current $\epsilon$cc assessment techniques require cardiac magnetic resonance-tagged imaging sequences, and their analysis is complex. The FT method can readily be performed on standard cine (steady-state free precession) sequences. Methods: We compared mid-left ventricular whole-slice $\epsilon$cc by the 2 techniques in 191 DMD patients grouped according to age and severity of cardiac dysfunction: group B: DMD patients 10 years and younger with normal ejection fraction (EF); group C: DMD patients older than 10 years with normal EF; group D: DMD patients older than 10 years with reduced EF but negative myocardial delayed enhancement (MDE); group E: DMD patients older than 10 years with reduced EF and positive MDE; and group A: 42 control subjects. Retrospective, offline analysis was performed on matched tagged and steady-state free precession slices. Results: For the entire study population (N = 233), mean FT $\epsilon$cc values (-13.3 $\pm$ 3.8\%) were highly correlated with HARP $\epsilon$cc values (-13.6 $\pm$ 3.4\%), with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.899. The mean $\epsilon$cc of DMD patients determined by HARP (-12.52 $\pm$ 2.69\%) and FT (-12.16 $\pm$ 3.12\%) was not significantly different (p = NS). Similarly, the mean $\epsilon$cc of the control subjects by determined HARP (-18.85 $\pm$ 1.86) and FT (-18.81 $\pm$ 1.83) was not significantly different (p = NS). Excellent correlation between the 2 methods was found among subgroups A through E, except there was no significant difference in strain between groups B and C with FT analysis. Conclusions: FT-based assessment of $\epsilon$cc correlates highly with $\epsilon$cc derived from tagged images in a large DMD patient population with a wide range of cardiac dysfunction and can be performed without additional imaging. \textcopyright{} 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Acorn CorCap Cardiac Support Device (CSD; Acorn Cardiovascular Inc, St. Paul, MN) is a woven polyester jacket that is placed around the heart and designed to reverse the progressive remodeling associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the effects of the Acorn CSD on myofiber stress and ventricular function remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the Acorn CSD reduces end-diastolic (ED) myofiber stress. METHODS: A previously described weakly coupled biventricular finite element (FE) model and circulatory model based on magnetic resonance images of a dog with dilated cardiomyopathy was used. Virtual applications of the CSD alone (Acorn), CSD with rotated fabric fiber orientation (rotated), CSD with 5\% prestretch (tight), and CSD wrapped only around the left ventricle (LV; LV-only) were performed, and the effect on myofiber stress at ED and pump function was calculated. RESULTS: The Acorn CSD has a large effect on ED myofiber stress in the LV free wall, with reductions of 55\%, 79\%, 92\%, and 40\% in the Acorn, rotated, tight, and LV-only cases, respectively. However, there is a tradeoff in which the Acorn CSD reduces stroke volume at LV end-diastolic pressure of 8 mm Hg by 23\%, 25\%, 30\%, and 7\%, respectively, in the Acorn, rotated, tight, and LV-only cases. CONCLUSIONS: The Acorn CSD significantly reduces ED myofiber stress. However, CSD wrapped only around the LV was the only case with minimal negative effect on pump function. Findings suggest that LV-only CSD and Acorn fabric orientation should be optimized to allow maximal myofiber stress reduction with minimal reduction in pump function.},

In Part I, we have described the applied model and studied the influence of scatter of material characteristics varying in the cross-section with no variations along the filaments. In particular, we analyzed the influence of varying cross-sectional area, filament length and delayed activation. Inclusion of these effects has lead to a better interpretation of the experimental data, especially with respect to the gradual stiffness activation, post-peak behavior and some form of size effect. In the present paper, the length-related distributions of local stiffness and strength are included in terms of theoretical considerations and by applying the Monte Carlo type simulation of random fields. Such an approach allows us (1) to demonstrate the strong need for including length scale to random fluctuation of strength along the filaments and (2) to combine several sources of randomness in a single analysis so that their significance can be evaluated from the tensile test response.},

  abstract = {Although magnetic resonance tissue tagging is a useful tool for the non-invasive measurement of three-dimensional (3-D) heart wall motion, the clinical utility of current analysis techniques is limited by the prohibitively long time required for image analysis. A method was therefore developed for the reconstruction of 3-D heart wall motion directly from tagged magnetic resonance images, without prior identification of ventricular boundaries or tag stripe locations. The method utilized a finite-element model to describe the shape and motion of the heart. Initially, the model geometry was determined at the time of tag creation by fitting a small number of guide points which were placed interactively on the images. Model tags were then created within the model as material surfaces which defined the location of the magnetic tags. An objective function was derived to measure the degree of match between the model tags and the image stripes. The objective was minimized by allowing the model to deform directly under the influence of the images, utilizing an efficient method for calculating image-derived motion constraints. The model deformation could also be manipulated interactively by guide points. Experiments were performed using clinical images of a normal volunteer, as well as simulated images in which the true motion was specified. The root-mean-squared errors between the known and calculated displacement and strain for the simulated images were similar to those obtained using previous stripe-tracking and model-fitting methods. A significant improvement in analysis time was obtained for the normal volunteer and further improvements may allow the method to be applied in a 'real-time' clinical environment.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a rate dependent damage model and its implementation in transient dynamics. The rate dependent model is derived from a rate independent damage model simply by changing the expression of the damage evolution equation. The principle of the model follows the format of Perzyna viscoplasticity whereby the definition of the plastic multiplier is modified compared to a standard rate independent plasticity model. The rate dependent model can reproduce very well the major effects of the rate of loading on the response of concrete; that is, an increase of the material strength and a decrease of the softening tangent modulus with increasing strain rate. The wave propagation problem is assessed. We show that the resulting equations of motion are unconditionally hyperbolic. Well-posedness and mesh objectivity are verified numerically on a simple one-dimensional (1D) problem. As an example of implementation in a finite element calculation, the computation of the response of a reinforced concrete beam subjected to an impact is presented.},

  abstract = {Stress fibers (SFs), a contractile bundle of actin filaments, play a critical role in mechanotransduction in adherent cells; yet, the mechanical properties of SFs are poorly understood. Here, we measured tensile properties of single SFs by in vitro manipulation with cantilevers. SFs were isolated from cultured vascular smooth muscle cells with a combination of low ionic-strength extraction and detergent extraction and were stretched until breaking. The breaking force and the Young's modulus (assuming that SFs were isotropic) were, on average, 377 nN and 1.45 MPa, which were approximately 600-fold greater and three orders of magnitude lower, respectively, than those of actin filaments reported previously. Strain-induced stiffening was observed in the force-strain curve. We also found that the extracted SFs shortened to approximately 80\% of the original length in an ATP-independent manner after they were dislodged from the substrate, suggesting that SFs had preexisting strain in the cytoplasm. The force required for stretching the single SFs from the zero-stress length back to the original length was approximately 10 nN, which was comparable with the traction force level applied by adherent cells at single adhesion sites to maintain cell integrity. These results suggest that SFs can bear intracellular stresses that may affect overall cell mechanical properties and will impact interpretation of intracellular stress distribution and force-transmission mechanism in adherent cells.},

  abstract = {A new paradigm for ceramic composite structural components enables functionality in heat exchange, transpiration, detailed shape, and thermal strain management that significantly exceeds the prior art. The paradigm is based on the use of three-dimensional fiber reinforcement that: is tailored to the specific shape, stress, and thermal requirements of a structural application and therefore generally requires innovative textile methods for each real-features include the attainment of thin skins (less than 1 mm) that are nevertheless structurally robust, transpiration holes formed without cutting fibers, double curvature, compliant integral attachment to other structures that avoids thermal stress buildup, and microcomposite ceramic matrices that minimize spalling and allow the formation of smooth surfaces. All these features can be combined into structures of very varied gross shape and function, using a wide range of materials such as all-oxide systems and SiC and carbon fibers in SiC matrices. Illustrations are drawn from rocket nozzles, thermal protection systems, and gas turbine engines. The new den challenges that arise for such material/structure systems are being met by specialized computational modeling that departs significantly in the representation of materials behavior from that used in conventional finite element methods.},

  abstract = {The endothelial lining of blood vessels is subjected to a wide range of haemodynamically-generated shear-stress forces throughout the vascular system. In vivo and in vitro, endothelial cells change their morphology and biochemistry in response to shear stress in a force- and time-dependent way, or when a critical threshold is exceeded. The initial stimulus-response coupling mechanisms have not been identified, however. Recently, Lansman et al. described stretch-activated ion channels in endothelial cells and suggested that they could be involved in the response to mechanical forces generated by blood flow. The channels were relatively nonselective and were opened by membrane stretching induced by suction. Here we report whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of single arterial endothelial cells exposed to controlled levels of laminar shear stress in capillary flow tubes. A K+ selective, shear-stress-activated ionic current (designated Ik.s) was identified which is unlike previously described stretch-activated currents. Ik.s varies in magnitude and duration as a function of shear stress (half-maximal effect at 0.70 dyn cm-2), desensitizes slowly and recovers rapidly and fully on cessation of flow. Ik.s activity represents the earliest and fastest stimulus-response coupling of haemodynamic forces to endothelial cells yet found. We suggest that localized flow-activated hyperpolarization of endothelium involving Ik.s may participate in the regulation of vascular tone.},

  abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI) significantly alters the structure and function of the heart. As abnormal strain may drive heart failure and the generation of arrhythmias, we used computational methods to simulate a left ventricle with an MI over the course of a heartbeat to investigate strains and their potential implications to electrophysiology. We created a fully coupled finite element model of myocardial electromechanics consisting of a cellular physiological model, a bidomain electrical diffusion solver, and a nonlinear mechanics solver. A geometric mesh built from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of an ovine left ventricle suffering from a surgically induced anteroapical infarct was used in the model, cycled through the cardiac loop of inflation, isovolumic contraction, ejection, and isovolumic relaxation. Stretch-activated currents were added as a mechanism of mechanoelectric feedback. Elevated fiber and cross fiber strains were observed in the area immediately adjacent to the aneurysm throughout the cardiac cycle, with a more dramatic increase in cross fiber strain than fiber strain. Stretch-activated channels decreased action potential (AP) dispersion in the remote myocardium while increasing it in the border zone. Decreases in electrical connectivity dramatically increased the changes in AP dispersion. The role of cross fiber strain in MI-injured hearts should be investigated more closely, since results indicate that these are more highly elevated than fiber strain in the border of the infarct. Decreases in connectivity may play an important role in the development of altered electrophysiology in the high-stretch regions of the heart.},

  abstract = {A model for the active deformation of cardiac tissue considering orthotropic constitutive laws is introduced and studied. In particular, the passive mechanical properties of the myocardium are described by the Holzapfel-Ogden relation, whereas the activation model is based on the concept of active strain. There, an incompatible intermediate configuration is considered, which entails a multiplicative decomposition between active and passive deformation gradients. The underlying Euler\textendash{}Lagrange equations for minimizing the total energy are written in terms of these deformation factors, where the active part is assumed to depend, at the cell level, on the electrodynamics and on the specific orientation of the cardiomyocytes. The active strain formulation is compared with the classical active stress model from both numerical and modeling perspectives. The well-posedness of the linear system derived from a generic Newton iteration of the original problem is analyzed, and different mechanical activation functions are considered. Taylor\textendash{}Hood and MINI finite elements are used in the discretization of the overall mechanical problem. The results of several numerical experiments show that the proposed formulation is mathematically consistent and is able to represent the main features of the phenomenon, while allowing savings in computational costs.

Since then the spatial organization of the myocardial fibres has represented, as Pettigrew says, "an arrangement so unusual and perplexing, that it has long been considered as forming a kind of Gordian knot in Anatomy. Of the complexity of the arrangement I need not speak further than to say that Vesalius, Albinus, Haller and De Blainville, all confessed their-inability to unravel it". What is shown in the present paper is the result of an anatomical work, developed over 43 years, by means of which it has been shown that the ventricular myocardial mass consists of a band, curled in a helical way, which extends from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. This is illustrated by a silicone rubber model cast from an actual unrolled myocardial band.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study tests the hypothesis that hypocontractile, borderzone myocardium adjacent to an expanding infarct becomes progressively larger and more hypocontractile as remodeling continues. BACKGROUND: Early infarct expansion following anteroapical myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with progressive ventricular dilation and heart failure. The contribution of perfused, hypocontractile, borderzone myocardium to this process is unknown. METHODS: Using a sheep model of anteroapical infarction, sonomicrometry array localization and serial microsphere injections were used to track changes in regional myocardial contractility, geometry, and perfusion. Eight sheep were studied before and after infarction and two, five, and eight weeks later. Thirty intertransducer chord lengths were analyzed to measure regional contractility and serial changes in regional geometry at end systole. RESULTS: Beginning as a narrow band of fully perfused hypocontractile myocardium adjacent to the infarction, borderzone myocardium extends to involve additional contiguous myocardium that progressively loses contractile function as the heart remodels. Three distinct myocardial zones develop as a result of transmural MI: infarct, borderzone (perfused but hypocontractile), and remote (perfused and normally functioning). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that hypocontractile, fully perfused borderzone myocardium extends to involve contiguous normal myocardium during postinfarction remodeling. This borderzone myocardium is a unique type of perfused, hypocontractile myocardium, which is distinct from hibernating or stunned myocardium. Preventing extension of borderzone myocardium by medical or surgical means offers the prospect of preventing late-onset heart failure following transmural expanding MIs. ?? 2002 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

From detailed histological studies and diffusion tensor imaging, we now know that fibre orientations in humans vary gradually from approximately -70$^\circ$ in the outer wall to +80$^\circ$ in the inner wall. However, the creation of fibre orientation maps for computational analyses remains one of the most challenging problems in cardiac electrophysiology and cardiac mechanics. Here, we show that Poisson interpolation generates smoothly varying vector fields that satisfy a set of user-defined constraints in arbitrary domains. Specifically, we enforce the Poisson interpolation in the weak sense using a standard linear finite element algorithm for scalar-valued second-order boundary value problems and introduce the feature to be interpolated as a global unknown. User-defined constraints are then simply enforced in the strong sense as Dirichlet boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed concept is capable of generating smoothly varying fibre orientations, quickly, efficiently and robustly, both in a generic bi-ventricular model and in a patient-specific human heart. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the underlying algorithm is conceptually able to handle both arbitrarily and uniformly distributed user-defined constraints; however, the quality of the interpolation is best for uniformly distributed constraints. We anticipate our algorithm to be immediately transformative to experimental and clinical settings, in which it will allow us to quickly and reliably create smooth interpolations of arbitrary fields from data-sets, which are sparse but uniformly distributed.},

  abstract = {The recently emerged idea of incorporating strain or displacement discontinuities into standard finite element interpolations has triggered the development of powerful techniques that allow efficient modeling of regions with highly localized strains, e.g. of fracture process zones in concrete or shear bands in metals or soils. Following the pioneering work of Ortiz, Leroy, and Needleman, a number of studies on elements with embedded discontinuities were published during the past decade. It was demonstrated that local enrichments of the displacement and/or strain interpolation can improve the resolution of strain localization by finite clement models. The multitude of approaches proposed in the literature calls for a comparative study that would present the diverse techniques in a unified framework, point out their common features and differences, and find their limits of applicability. There are many aspects in which individual formulations differ, such as the type of discontinuity (weak/strong), variational principle used for the derivation of basic equations, constitutive law, etc. The present paper suggests a possible approach to their classification, with special attention to the type of kinematic enhancement and of internal equilibrium condition. The differences between individual formulations are elucidated by analyzing the behavior of the simplest finite element - the constant-strain triangle (CST). The sources of stress locking (spurious stress transfer) reported by some authors are analyzed. II is shown that there exist three major classes of models with embedded discontinuities but only one of them gives the optimal element behavior.},

The use of slab-selective excitations is common, as this can improve imaging speed by limiting the field of view (FOV). However, the necessarily short-duration excitations have poor slab profiles. This results in unusable slices at the slab edge due to significant flip-angle variations or aliasing in the slab direction. Variable-rate selective excitation (VERSE) is a technique by which a time-varying gradient waveform is combined with a modified RF waveform to provide the same excitation profile with different RF power and duration characteristics. With the use of VERSE, it is possible to design short-duration pulses with dramatically improved slab profiles. These pulses achieve high flip angles with only minor off-resonance sensitivity, while meeting SAR limits at 1.5 T. The improved slab profiles will enable more rapid 3D imaging of limited volumes, with more consistent image contrast across the excited slab.},

Such situations fall outside the scope of classical plasticity theory which assumes either infinitesimal strains or plastic-rigid theory for large strains. The present theory modifies the kinematics to include finite elastic and plastic strain components. For situations requiring this generalization, dilatational influences are usually significant including thermomechanical coupling. This is introduced through the consideration of two coupled thermodynamic systems: one comprising thermoelasticity at finite strain and the other the irreversible process of dissipation and absorption of plastic work. The present paper generalizes a previous theory to permit arbitrary deformation histories.},

Reliable numerical prediction tools based on both geometrical and mechanical modeling are required to quantitatively characterize the role of the microstructure and damage mechanisms at the mesoscale. In this paper, a computational strategy is proposed illustrating a generic two-dimensional repeating unit cell of a SiC/SiC plain weave composite with chemical vapor infiltrated matrix. Tows damage mechanisms are introduced through a nonlinear model based on damage mechanics as well as homogenization of a micromechanical model on the fiber scale. Particular attention is paid to the generation of accurate hexahedral meshes, compatible at the tow-tow and tow-matrix interfaces. The mesh quality is verified using an error estimator variable based on the strain energy density. Intra-yarn damage prediction obtained using tetrahedral and hexahedral elements is tested and compared considering the representative unit cell subjected to tensile loading.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.athoracsur.2012.03.001},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We sought to determine regional myofiber stress after Coapsys device (Myocor, Inc, Maple Grove, MN) implantation using a finite element model of the left ventricle (LV). Chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation is caused by LV remodeling after posterolateral myocardial infarction. The Coapsys device consists of a single trans-LV chord placed below the mitral valve such that when tensioned it alters LV shape and decreases chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation. METHODS: Finite element models of the LV were based on magnetic resonance images obtained before (preoperatively) and after (postoperatively) coronary artery bypass grafting with Coapsys implantation in a single patient. To determine the effect of Coapsys and LV before stress, virtual Coapsys was performed on the preoperative model. Diastolic and systolic material variables in the preoperative, postoperative, and virtual Coapsys models were adjusted so that model LV volume agreed with magnetic resonance imaging data. Chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation was abolished in the postoperative models. In each case, myofiber stress and pump function were calculated. RESULTS: Both postoperative and virtual Coapsys models shifted end-systolic and end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships to the left. As a consequence and because chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation was reduced after Coapsys, pump function was unchanged. Coapsys decreased myofiber stress at end-diastole and end-systole in both the remote and infarct regions of the myocardium. However, knowledge of Coapsys and LV prestress was necessary for accurate calculation of LV myofiber stress, especially in the remote zone. CONCLUSIONS: Coapsys decreases myofiber stress at end-diastole and end-systole. The improvement in myofiber stress may contribute to the long-term effect of Coapsys on LV remodeling.},

Multifilament tows and single filaments were tested. Experimental data show that the rupture times of tows depend on the applied stress according to the conventional power law t$\sigma$n = A. In contrast, the stress-rupture time data obtained on single filaments exhibit significant scatter. A model based on slow crack growth in single filaments shows that the stress-rupture of fiber tows follows the conventional time power law. The dependence on temperature was introduced. The model allowed sound calculations of tow lifetimes and characteristics of the slow crack growth phenomenon to be extracted from the tow stress-rupture time data.},

The paper deals with the processing, the mechanical behaviour and the oxidation resistance of a carbon-fiber-reinforced multilayer ceramic-matrix composite. The efficiency of this matrix is compared to that of the classical anti-oxidation systems based on an external coating usually employed to reduce the oxygen permeation. The efficiency of the oxidation protection of the multilayer ceramic matrix is still evident in spite of the complex architecture of the fibrous preform and the damage of the matrix. The experimental results show that a strong improvement in the lifetime of such composites under thermomechanical loading and in an oxygen environment is obtained when a multilayer matrix is used to protect the carbon reinforcement against oxidation.},

Simple relations are proposed to model these coupled phenomena and a continuum model developed for simulating cell contractility. The model is capable of predicting key experimentally established characteristics including: (i) the decrease in the forces generated by the cell with increasing substrate compliance, (ii) the influence of cell shape and boundary conditions on the development of structural anisotropy, and (iii) the high concentration of the stress fibers at the focal adhesions.

Phys. 79, 12) and address two important issues that are intrinsic to the level set method: (a) how to extend a quantity that is given only on the interface to a neighborhood of the interface; (b) how to reset the level set function to be a signed distance function to the interface efficiently without appreciably moving the interface. This fast local level set method reduces the computational effort by one order of magnitude, works in as much generality as the original one, and is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Our approach differs from previous relatedworks in that we extract all the information needed from the level set function (or functions in multiphase flow) and do not need to find explicitly the location of the interface in the space domain. The complexity of our method to do tasks such as extension and distance reinitialization is O(N), where N is the number of points in space, not O(N log N) as in works by Sethian (1996, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 93, 1591) and Helmsen and co-workers (1996, SPIE Microlithography IX, p. 253).

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been an explosive growth of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques that allow faster scan speed by exploiting temporal or spatiotemporal redundancy of the images. These techniques improve the performance of dynamic imaging significantly across multiple clinical applications, including cardiac functional examinations, perfusion imaging, blood flow assessment, contrast-enhanced angiography, functional MRI, and interventional imaging, among others. The scan acceleration permits higher spatial resolution, increased temporal resolution, shorter scan duration, or a combination of these benefits. Along with the exciting developments is a dizzying proliferation of acronyms and variations of the techniques. The present review attempts to summarize this rapidly growing topic and presents conceptual frameworks to understand these techniques in terms of their underlying mechanics and connections. Techniques from view sharing, keyhole, k-t, to compressed sensing are covered.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.04.022},
  abstract = {Evidence from animal models suggest that t-tubule changes may play an important role in the contractile deficit associated with heart failure. However samples are usually taken at random with no regard as to regional variability present in failing hearts which leads to uncertainty in the relationship between contractile performance and possible t-tubule derangement. Regional contraction in human hearts was measured by tagged cine MRI and model fitting. At transplant, failing hearts were biopsy sampled in identified regions and immunocytochemistry was used to label t-tubules and sarcomeric z-lines. Computer image analysis was used to assess 5 different unbiased measures of t-tubule structure/organization. In regions of failing hearts that showed good contractile performance, t-tubule organization was similar to that seen in normal hearts, with worsening structure correlating with the loss of regional contractile performance. Statistical analysis showed that t-tubule direction was most highly correlated with local contractile performance, followed by the amplitude of the sarcomeric peak in the Fourier transform of the t-tubule image. Other area based measures were less well correlated. We conclude that regional contractile performance in failing human hearts is strongly correlated with the local t-tubule organization. Cluster tree analysis with a functional definition of failing contraction strength allowed a pathological definition of 't-tubule disease'. The regional variability in contractile performance and cellular structure is a confounding issue for analysis of samples taken from failing human hearts, although this may be overcome with regional analysis by using tagged cMRI and biopsy mapping.},

Finally, patient-specific modeling has enabled an entirely new application of cardiovascular mechanics, namely predicting outcomes of alternate therapeutic interventions for individual patients.

We investigate two aspects. The first one focuses on pre-operative multimodal image data. From 2D echocardiography and 3D tagged MRI images, we compute atlas based dyssynchrony indices. We complement these indices with presence and extent of scar tissue and correlate them with CRT response. The second one focuses on computational models. We use pre-operative imaging to generate a patient-specific computational model. We show results of a fully automatic personalized electromechanical simulation. By case-per-case discussion of the results, we highlight the potential and key issues of this multimodal pipeline for the understanding of the mechanisms of CRT response and a better patient selection.},

On the basis of ID continuum damage models it is shown that, by introducing some few ingredients like the strong discontinuity kinematics, discrete constitutive models (traction vs. displacement jumps) are automatically induced. For the general 2D-3D cases it is shown that the weak discontinuity concept is an additional ingredient, necessary in order to fulfill the strong discontinuity conditions, which allows to establish additional links with the fracture process zone concept. Also classical fracture mechanics properties as the fracture energy are related to the continuum model properties in a straightforward manner.},

  title = {Elevated-Temperature Crack Growth in Polycrystalline Alumina under Static and Cyclic Loads},
  volume = {27},
  abstract = {An experimental investigation has been conducted to study the crack growth characteristics of a 90\% pure aluminium oxide in 1050-degrees-C air under static and cyclic loads. It is shown that the application of both sustained and fluctuating tensile loads to the ceramic, tested in a precracked four-point bend specimen configuration, results in appreciable subcritical crack growth. The crack velocities under cyclic loading conditions are up to two orders of magnitude slower than those measured in static loading under the same maximum stress intensity factor. Cyclic crack growth rates are markedly affected by the loading frequency, with a decrease in test frequency causing an increase in the rate of crack advance. Detailed optical and electron microscopy observations have been made in an attempt to study the mechanisms of stable crack growth and the mechanistic differences between static fatigue fracture. Under both static and cyclic loads, the predominant mode of fracture is intergranular separation, The presence of a glass phase along the grain boundaries appears to have a strong effect on the mechanisms of crack growth. Apparent differences in the crack velocities between static and cyclic fatigue in alumina arise from crack-wake contact effects as well as from the rate-sensitivity of deformation of the glass phase. Our results also indicate that the cyclic fatigue crack growth rates cannot be predicted solely on the basis of sustained load fracture data. While stable crack growth occurs in the 90\% pure alumina over a range of stress intensity factor spanning 1.5 to 5 MPa m1/2, such subcritical fracture is essentially suppressed in a 99.9\% pure alumina, ostensibly due to the paucity of a critical amount of glass phase. Both static and cyclic fracture characteristics of the 90\% pure alumina are qualitatively similar to those found in an Al2O3- SiC composite where in situ formation of glass phases, due to the oxidation of SiC in high-temperature air, is known to be an important factor in the fracture process.},

For automatic analysis of the 3D-CSPAMM data set, evaluation software, based on a 3D extension of the HARP technique, was used. RESULTS: Successful application of the 3D-CSPAMM technique in healthy subjects allowed the accurate determination of quantitative 3D motion patterns in the human heart.

  abstract = {Biochemical processes of tissue growth lead to production of new proteins, cells, and other material particles at the microscopic level. At the macroscopic level, growth is marked by the change of the tissue shape and mass. In addition, the appearance of the new material particles is generally accompanied by deformation and, consequently, stresses in the surrounding material. Built upon a microscopic toy-tissue model mimicking the mechanical processes of mass supply, a simple phenomenological theory of tissue growth is used in the present work for explaining residual stresses in arteries and studying stresses around growing solid tumors/multicell spheroids. It is shown, in particular, that the uniform volumetric growth can lead to accumulation of residual stresses in arteries because of the material anisotropy. This can be a complementary source of residual stresses in arteries as compared to the stresses induced by non-uniform tissue growth. It is argued that the quantitative assessment of the residual stresses based on in vitro experiments may not be reliable because of the essential stress redistribution in the tissue samples under the cutting process. Concerning the problem of tumor growth, it is shown that the multicell spheroid or tumor evolution depends on elastic properties of surrounding tissues. In good qualitative agreement with the experimental in vitro observations on growing multicell spheroids, numerical simulations confirm that stiff hosting tissues can inhibit tumor growth.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with multiple underlying causes. Wild-type transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTRwt) is an underdiagnosed cause of HFpEF that might benefit from new specific treatments. ATTRwt can be diagnosed non-invasively by (99m)Tc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid ((99m)Tc-DPD) scintigraphy. We sought to determine the prevalence of ATTRwt among elderly patients admitted due to HFpEF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively screened all consecutive patients $\geq$60 years old admitted due to HFpEF [left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction $\geq$50\%] with LV hypertrophy ($\geq$12 mm). All eligible patients were offered a (99m)Tc-DPD scintigraphy. The study included 120 HFpEF patients (59\% women, 82 $\pm$ 8 years). A total of 16 patients (13.3\%; 95\% confidence interval: 7.2-19.5) showed a moderate-to-severe uptake on the (99m)Tc-DPD scintigraphy. All patients with a positive scan underwent genetic testing of the TTR gene, and no mutations were found. An endomyocardial biopsy was performed in four patients, confirming ATTRwt in all cases. There were no differences in age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, or atrial fibrillation between ATTRwt patients and patients with other HFpEF forms. Although patients with ATTRwt exhibited higher median N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (6467 vs. 3173 pg/L; P = 0.019), median troponin I (0.135 vs. 0.025 $\mathrm{\mu}$g/L; P $\backslash$textless 0.001), mean LV maximal wall thickness (17 $\pm$ 3.4 vs. 14 $\pm$ 2.5 mm; P = 0.001), rate of pericardial effusion (44 vs. 19\%; P = 0.047), and rate of pacemakers (44 vs. 12\%; P = 0.004), clinical overlap between ATTRwt and other HFpEF forms was high. CONCLUSION: ATTRwt is an underdiagnosed disease that accounts for a significant number (13\%) of HFpEF cases. The effect of emerging TTR-modifying drugs should be evaluated in these patients.},

  abstract = {Segmentation is a characteristic feature of the vertebrate body plan. The prevailing paradigm explaining its origin is the `clock and wave-front' model, which assumes that the interaction of a molecular oscillator (clock) with a traveling gradient of morphogens (wave) pre-defines spatial periodicity. While many genes potentially responsible for these processes have been identified, the precise role of molecular oscillations and the mechanism leading to physical separation of the somites remain elusive. In this paper we argue that the periodicity along the embryonic body axis anticipating somitogenesis is controlled by mechanical rather than bio-chemical signaling. Using a prototypical model we show that regular patterning can result from a mechanical instability induced by differential strains developing between the segmenting mesoderm and the surrounding tissues. The main ingredients of the model are the assumptions that cell\textendash{}cell adhesions soften when overstretched, and that there is an internal length scale defining the cohesive properties of the mesoderm. The proposed mechanism generates a robust number of segments without dependence on genetic oscillations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the accepted utility of delayed-enhancement MRI in identifying irreversible myocardial injury, no study has yet assessed its role as a viability tool exclusively in the setting of coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), and no study has repeated delayed-enhancement MRI late after revascularization. In a clinical trial in which patients underwent CABG by either the off-pump or on-pump surgical technique, we hypothesized that (1) preoperative delayed-enhancement MRI would have high diagnostic accuracy in predicting viability and (2) the occurrence of perioperative myocardial necrosis would affect late regional wall motion recovery. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-two patients undergoing multivessel CABG were studied by preoperative and early (day 6) and late (6 months) postoperative cine MRI for global and regional functional assessment and delayed-enhancement MRI for assessment of irreversible myocardial injury. Preoperatively, 611 segments (21\%) had abnormal regional function, whereas 421 segments (14\%) showed evidence of hyperenhancement. At 6 months after revascularization, 57\% (343 of 611) of dysfunctional segments improved contraction by at least 1 grade. When all preoperative dysfunctional segments were analyzed, there was a strong correlation between the transmural extent of hyperenhancement and the recovery in regional function at 6 months (P$\backslash$textless0.001). Of a total of 96 previously dysfunctional but nonenhancing or minimally hyperenhancing myocardial segments that did not improve regional function at 6 months, 35 (36\%) demonstrated new perioperative hyperenhancement in the early postoperative MRI scan. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed-enhancement MRI is a powerful predictor of myocardial viability after surgery, suggesting an important role for this technique in clinical viability assessment.},

To validate the method of strain estimation and quantify the error of deformation estimates, a deformable silicone gel phantom in the shape of a cylindrical anulus was built and imaged. Four observers digitized the displacement of magnetic tags in two deformation modes: axial shear, caused by a 45 degrees rotation of the inner cylinder, and azimuthal shear, caused by a 13.5-mm longitudinal translation of the inner cylinder. In axial shear, good agreement was found between the angular displacement of stripes painted on the gel and an analytic solution. Displacement of magnetic tags also agreed with that solution. Interobserver and observer-model errors in deformation estimates were quantified for homogeneous and nonhomogeneous strain analysis. In homogeneous strain analysis, errors in point localization produced relatively large errors, which were reduced in nonhomogeneous strain analysis. Both estimates were unbiased across the range of deformations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both the Young-Laplace law and finite element (FE) based methods have been used to calculate left ventricular wall stress. We tested the hypothesis that the Young-Laplace law is able to reproduce results obtained with the FE method. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging scans with noninvasive tags were used to calculate three-dimensional myocardial strain in 5 sheep 16 weeks after anteroapical myocardial infarction, and in 1 of those sheep 6 weeks after a Dor procedure. Animal-specific FE models were created from the remaining 5 animals using magnetic resonance images obtained at early diastolic filling. The FE-based stress in the fiber, cross-fiber, and circumferential directions was calculated and compared to stress calculated with the assumption that wall thickness is very much less than the radius of curvature (Young-Laplace law), and without that assumption (modified Laplace). RESULTS: First, circumferential stress calculated with the modified Laplace law is closer to results obtained with the FE method than stress calculated with the Young-Laplace law. However, there are pronounced regional differences, with the largest difference between modified Laplace and FE occurring in the inner and outer layers of the infarct borderzone. Also, stress calculated with the modified Laplace is very different than stress in the fiber and cross-fiber direction calculated with FE. As a consequence, the modified Laplace law is inaccurate when used to calculate the effect of the Dor procedure on regional ventricular stress. CONCLUSIONS: The FE method is necessary to determine stress in the left ventricle with postinfarct and surgical ventricular remodeling.},

  doi = {10.1016/0021-9290(92)90069-D},
  abstract = {The dependence of local left ventricular (LV) mechanics on myocardial muscle fiber orientation was investigated using a finite element model. In the model we have considered anisotropy of the active and passive components of myocardial tissue, dependence of active stress on time, strain and strain rate, activation sequence of the LV wall and aortic afterload. Muscle fiber orientation in the LV wall is quantified by the helix fiber angle, defined as the angle between the muscle fiber direction and the local circumferential direction. In a first simulation, a transmural variation of the helix fiber angle from +60$^\circ$ at the endocardium through 0$^\circ$ in the midwall layers to -60$^\circ$ at the epicardium was assumed. In this simulation, at the equatorial level maximum active muscle fiber stress was found to vary from about 110 kPa in the subendocardial layers through about 30 kPa in the midwall layers to about 40 kPa in the subepicardial layers. Next, in a series of simulations, muscle fiber orientation was iteratively adapted until the spatial distribution of active muscle fiber stress was fairly homogeneous. Using a transmural course of the helix fiber angle of +60$^\circ$ at the endocardium, +15$^\circ$ in the midwall layers and -60$^\circ$ at the epicardium, at the equatorial level maximum active muscle fiber stress varied from 52 kPa to 55 kPa, indicating a remarkable reduction of the stress range. Moreover, the change of muscle fiber strain with time was more similar in different parts of the LV wall than in the first simulation. It is concluded that (1) the distribution of active muscle fiber stress and muscle fiber strain across the LV wall is very sensitive to the transmural distribution of the helix fiber angle and (2) a physiological transmural distribution of the helix fiber angle can be found, at which active muscle fiber stress and muscle fiber strain are distributed approximately homogeneously across the LV wall.},

  abstract = {Bioresorbable scaffolds with mechanical properties suitable for bone tissue engineering were fabricated from polycaprolactone (PCL) and hydroxyapatite (HA) by selective laser sintering (SLS) and modeled by finite-element analysis (FEA). Both solid gage parts and scaffolds having 1-D, 2-D and 3-D orthogonal, periodic porous architectures were made with 0, 10, 20 and 30vol.\% HA. PCL:HA scaffolds manufactured by SLS had nearly full density (99\%) in the designed solid regions and had excellent geometric and dimensional control. Through optimization of the SLS process, the compressive moduli for our solid gage parts and scaffolds are the highest reported in the literature for additive manufacturing. The compressive moduli of solid gage parts were 299.3, 311.2, 415.5 and 498.3MPa for PCL:HA loading at 100:0, 90:10, 80:20 and 70:30, respectively. The compressive effective stiffness tended to increase as the loading of HA was increased and the designed porosity was lowered. In the case of the most 3-D porous scaffold, the compressive modulus more than doubled from 14.9 to 36.2MPa when changing the material from 100:0 to 70:30 PCL:HA. A micromechanical FEA model was developed to investigate the reinforcement effect of HA loading on the compressive modulus of the bulk material. Using a first-principles based approach, the random distribution of HA particles in a solidified PCL matrix was modeled for any HA loading to predict the bulk mechanical properties of the composites. The bulk mechanical properties were also used for FEA of the scaffold geometries. The results of the FEA were found to be in good agreement with experimental mechanical testing. The development of patient- and site-specific composite tissue-engineering constructs with tailored properties can be seen as a direct extension of this work on computational design, a priori modeling of mechanical properties and direct digital manufacturing.},

In fact, the selected candidate theories either show a discontinuous stress-strain response when the unilateral condition takes place or an unacceptable nonsymmetric elastic behaviour for some loading conditions.

  abstract = {Electrical waves traveling throughout the myocardium elicit muscle contractions responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. The shape and direction of these waves depend on the spatial arrangement of ventricular myocytes, termed fiber orientation. In computational studies simulating electrical wave propagation or mechanical contraction in the heart, accurately representing fiber orientation is critical so that model predictions corroborate with experimental data. Typically, fiber orientation is assigned to heart models based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, yet few alternative methodologies exist if DTI data is noisy or absent. Here we present a novel Laplace-Dirichlet Rule-Based (LDRB) algorithm to perform this task with speed, precision, and high usability. We demonstrate the application of the LDRB algorithm in an image-based computational model of the canine ventricles. Simulations of electrical activation in this model are compared to those in the same geometrical model but with DTI-derived fiber orientation. The results demonstrate that activation patterns from simulations with LDRB and DTI-derived fiber orientations are nearly indistinguishable, with relative differences $\leq$6\%, absolute mean differences in activation times $\leq$3.15 ms, and positive correlations $\geq$0.99. These results convincingly show that the LDRB algorithm is a robust alternative to DTI for assigning fiber orientation to computational heart models.},

Many attempts have been made to model this behavior in biology, chemistry, and physics. Using the theory of finite elasticity, Rodriguez has postulated a multiplicative decomposition of the geometric deformation gradient into a growth-induced part and an elastic one needed to ensure compatibility of the body. In order to fully explore the consequences of this hypothesis, the equations describing thin elastic objects under finite growth are derived. Under appropriate scaling assumptions for the growth rates, the proposed model is of the Foppl-von Karman type. As an illustration, the circumferential growth of a free hyperelastic disk is studied.},

  volume = {41},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the precision of measuring the pennation angle and fiber length in the vastus lateralis (VL) using two distinctly different diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We imaged the thigh of 10 normal subjects on a 3T magnetic resonance (MR) imager with twice refocused spin echo (TRSE) and stimulated echo (STEAM) DTI-MRI techniques. Both techniques took the same total acquisition time and employed the same diffusion weighting and gradient directions. Using the diffusion tensor images produced by each sequence, muscle fiber bundles were tracked from the aponeurosis by following the first eigenvector of the diffusion tensor. From these tracks we calculated the pennation angle and fiber length. RESULTS: The STEAM acquisition resulted in significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), lower apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), higher fractional anisotropy (FA) values, and longer fibers than TRSE. Although no difference in the pennation angle between the two acquisitions was found, the TRSE sequence had a significantly greater within-subject dispersion in the pennation angle of tracked fibers, which may indicate a reduction in the coherence of fiber bundles. CONCLUSION: DTI of muscle using a STEAM acquisition resulted in significant improvements in the SNR and FA, resulting in tracking a larger number of muscle fiber bundles over longer distances and with less within-subject dispersion.},

The CArdiac Resynchronisation-Heart Failure study is the only long-term randomized trial of CRT with repeated measures of QoL. METHODS: Quality of life was measured at baseline and 3 months using generic European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions and disease-specific (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure) questionnaires and at 18 months and study-end using the latter instrument. Median follow-up was 29.6 (interquartile range 23.6-34.6) months. RESULTS: At baseline, patients had a substantially impaired QoL (mean European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions score 0.60, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-0.62) compared to an age-matched general population (0.78, 95\% CI 0.76-0.80). Quality of life improved to a greater extent in patients assigned to CRT at each time point (P $\backslash$textless .0001). By 18 months, the mean difference in disease-specific QoL score was 10.7 (95\% CI 7.6-13.8) in favor of CRT, mostly due to improved physical functioning. Differences were sustained thereafter. Quality-adjusted life-years at 18 months increased by 0.13 (95\% CI 0.07-0.182) and by 0.23 (95\% CI 0.13-0.33) at study-end (both P $\backslash$textless .0001). Little heterogeneity of effect across subgroups was observed. CONCLUSION: Cardiac resynchronization therapy improves long-term QoL and survival in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. The effects appear sustained, and therefore, the gain in quality-adjusted life years with CRT should be even greater during longer term follow-up.},

The inherent challenges associated with simulating phase field models across multiple length and time scales are discussed, as well as how these challenges have been addressed in recent years. Specifi- cally, we discuss new asymptotic analysis methods that enable phase field equations to emulate the sharp interface limit even in the case of quite diffuse phase-field interfaces, an aspect that greatly reduces computation times.We then review recent dynamic adap- tive mesh refinement algorithms that have enabled a dramatic increase in the scale of microstructures that can be simulated using phase-field models, at significantly reduced simulation times. Combined with new methods of asymptotic analysis, the adaptive mesh approach provides a truly multi-scale capability for simulating solidification mi- crostructures from nanometers up to centimeters. Finally, we present recent results on 2D and 3D dendritic growth and dendritic spacing selection, which have been made using phase-field models solved with adaptive mesh refinement.},

For the planar case it is shown that all possible types of elastic behaviour may be represented by composition of four sets of parallel fibres in appropriate ratios. The means of transfer of load from fibre to fibre are considered and it is concluded that the effect of short fibres may be represented merely by use of a reduced value for their modulus of elasticity.

  abstract = {The constitutive law of the material comprising any structure is essential for mechanical analysis since this law enables calculation of the stresses from the deformations and vice versa. To date, there is no constitutive law for actively contracting myocardial tissue. Using 2,3-butanedione monoxime to protect the myocardium from mechanical trauma, we subjected thin midwall slices of rabbit myocardium to multiaxial stretching first in the passive state and then during steady-state barium contracture or during tetani in ryanodine-loaded tissue. Assuming transverse isotropy in both the passive and active conditions, we used our previously described methods (Humphrey et al., 1990a) to obtain both passive and active constitutive laws. The major results of this study are: (1) This is the first multiaxial constitutive law for actively contracting mammalian myocardium. (2) The functional forms of the constitutive law for barium contracture and ryanodine-induced tetani are the same but differ from those in the passive state. Hence, one cannot simply substitute differing values for the coefficients of the passive law to describe the active tissue properties. (3) There are significant stresses developed in the cross-fiber direction (more than 40 percent of those in the fiber direction) that cannot be attributed to either deformation effects or nonparallel muscle fibers. These results provide the foundation for future mechanical analyses of the heart.},

In this work, ceramic scaffold with different HA/$\beta$-TCP compositions (pure HA, 60HA/40$\beta$-TCP, and 20HA/80$\beta$-TCP) were fabricated by a robotic-assisted deposition (robocasting) technique using water-based hydrogel inks. A systematic study was conducted to investigate the porosity, mechanical property, and degradation of the scaffolds. Our results indicate that, at a similar volume porosity, the mechanical strength of the sintered scaffolds increased with the decreasing rod diameter. The compressive strength of the fabricated scaffolds (porosity $\approx$ 25-80 vol \%) varied between $\sim$3 and $\sim$50 MPa, a value equal or higher than that of human cancellous bone (2-12 MPa). Although there was a slight increase of Ca and P ions in water after 5 month, no noticeable degradation of the scaffolds in SBF or water was observed. Our findings from this work indicate that composite calcium phosphate scaffolds with customer-designed chemistry and architecture may be fabricated by a robotic-assisted deposition method.},

The complexity of the mathematical model motivates numerical methods based on operator splitting, but simple explicit splitting schemes have been shown to give severe stability problems for realistic models of cardiac electro-mechanical coupling. The stability may be improved by adopting semi-implicit schemes, but these give rise to challenges in updating and linearising the active tension. In this paper we present an operator splitting framework for strongly coupled electro-mechanical simulations and discuss alternative strategies for updating and linearising the active stress component. Numerical experiments demonstrate considerable performance increases from an update method based on a generalised Rush-Larsen scheme and a consistent linearisation of active stress based on the first elasticity tensor.},

While previous works dealt mainly with the in-plane behavior of the laminate, here we introduce the out-of-plane part of the behavior, which is essential for the simulation of delamination. This results in a better understanding, consistent with micromechanics, of the mesomechanics of laminated composites introduced at Cachan and developed particularly there for more than 15 years.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To construct a temperature-controlled diffusion phantom with known diffusion properties and geometry in order to facilitate the comparison and optimization of diffusion sequences with the objective of increasing the precision of experimentally derived diffusion parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A temperature-stabilized diffusion phantom made up of two crossing strands of hydrophobic polyethylene fibers was constructed. Reproducibility and temperature dependence of several diffusion parameters was investigated and compared with computer simulations. Furthermore, in order to stimulate actual use, the precision of measurement of different diffusion-encoding schemes was compared using bootstrap analysis. RESULTS: The measured values of the diffusion parameters are highly reproducible and feature strong temperature dependence which is reproduced in simulations, underlining the necessity of a temperature-stabilized environment for quality control. The exemplary application presented here demonstrates that the phantom allows comparing and optimizing different diffusion sequences with regard to their measurement precision. CONCLUSION: The present work demonstrates that the diffusion phantom facilitates and improves the comparison and quality control of diffusion sequences and the ensuing parameters. The results show that an accurate temperature control is a vital prerequisite for highly reproducible calibration measurements. As such, the phantom might provide a valuable calibration tool for clinical studies.},

  abstract = {The pattern of blood flow in the developing heart has long been proposed to play a significant role in cardiac morphogenesis. In response to flow-induced forces, cultured cardiac endothelial cells rearrange their cytoskeletal structure and change their gene expression profiles. To link such in vitro data to the intact heart, we performed quantitative in vivo analyses of intracardiac flow forces in zebrafish embryos. Using in vivo imaging, here we show the presence of high-shear, vortical flow at two key stages in the developing heart, and predict flow-induced forces much greater than might have been expected for micro-scale structures at low Reynolds numbers. To test the relevance of these shear forces in vivo, flow was occluded at either the cardiac inflow or outflow tracts, resulting in hearts with an abnormal third chamber, diminished looping and impaired valve formation. The similarity of these defects to those observed in some congenital heart diseases argues for the importance of intracardiac haemodynamics as a key epigenetic factor in embryonic cardiogenesis.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00330-014-3322-7},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the accuracy of post-mortem diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for the detection of myocardial infarction (MI) and to demonstrate the feasibility of helix angle (HA) calculation to study remodelling of myofibre architecture. METHODS: Cardiac DTI was performed in 26 deceased subjects prior to autopsy for medicolegal reasons. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were determined. Accuracy was calculated on per-segment (AHA classification), per-territory, and per-patient basis, with pathology as reference standard. HAs were calculated and compared between healthy segments and those with MI. RESULTS: Autopsy demonstrated MI in 61/440 segments (13.9 \%) in 12/26 deceased subjects. Healthy myocardial segments had significantly higher FA (p $\backslash$textless 0.01) and lower MD (p $\backslash$textless 0.001) compared to segments with MI. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that FA (p $\backslash$textless 0.10) and MD (p = 0.01) with the covariate post-mortem time (p $\backslash$textless 0.01) predicted MI with an accuracy of 0.73. Analysis of HA distribution demonstrated remodelling of myofibre architecture, with significant differences between healthy segments and segments with chronic (p $\backslash$textless 0.001) but not with acute MI (p $\backslash$textgreater 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Post-mortem cardiac DTI enablesdifferentiation between healthy and infarcted myocardial segments by means of FA and MD. HA assessment allows for the demonstration of remodelling of myofibre architecture following chronic MI. KEY POINTS: \textbullet{} DTI enables post-mortem detection of myocardial infarction with good accuracy. \textbullet{} A decrease in right-handed helical fibre indicates myofibre remodelling following chronic myocardial infarction. \textbullet{} DTI allows for ruling out myocardial infarction by means of FA. \textbullet{} Post-mortem DTI may represent a valuable screening tool in forensic investigations.},

  abstract = {A key issue for the fabrication of scaffolds for tissue engineering is the development of processing techniques flexible enough to produce materials with a wide spectrum of solubility (bioresorption rates) and mechanical properties matching those of calcified tissues. These techniques must also have the capability of generating adequate porosity to further serve as a framework for cell penetration, new bone formation, and subsequent remodeling. In this study we show how hybrid organic/inorganic scaffolds with controlled microstructures can be built using robotic assisted deposition at room temperature. Polylactide or polycaprolactone scaffolds with pore sizes ranging between 200-500 microm and hydroxyapatite contents up to 70 wt \% were fabricated. Compressive tests revealed an anisotropic behavior of the scaffolds, strongly dependant on their chemical composition. The inclusion of an inorganic component increased their stiffness but they were not brittle and could be easily machined even for ceramic contents up to 70 wt \%. The mechanical properties of hybrid scaffolds did not degrade significantly after 20 days in simulated body fluid. However, the stiffness of pure polylactide scaffolds increased drastically due to polymer densification. Scaffolds containing bioactive glasses were also printed. After 20 days in simulated body fluid they developed an apatite layer on their surface.},

The best densification conditions for 60; 120 and 320 mu m model pores, by pyrocarbon, are T = 900-1000 degrees C; P-2 = 1-3 kPa and t(R) = a few s. Even under such conditions, a thickness gradient is always present along the pore axis. Filling ratios as high as 90\% are observed for the largest pores. Smooth or rough laminar pyrocarbon is deposited depending on the value of t(R) and hence the maturation of the gas phase. Multilayered (PyC-SiC), interphases (with n = 10-30 ; e(PyC) = 3-50 nm and e (SiC) = 10 or 30 nm) act as mechanical fuses and are more resistant to oxidation than pyrocarbon interphase.

The interphase is either formed in situ as the result of fibre-matrix interactions or deposited on the fibre surface prior to composite fabrication. It has several key functions, including crack deflection, load transfer, diffusion barrier and residual stress relaxation. Four types of interphase are depicted involving weak interfaces, materials with a layered crystal structure (pyrocarbon, BN, micas and phyllosiloxides, or materials with the beta-alumina/magnetoplumbite structures), multilayers such as (PyC-SiC)(n) or (BN-SiC)(n) or, finally, porous materials. Achieving high mechanical properties and long lifetimes in severe environments require a subtle design of the fibre-matrix interfacial zone, which is depicted for Nicalon/glass-ceramic and Nicalon/SiC-matrix composites.},

  abstract = {Pumping power as delivered by the heart is generated by the cells in the myocardial wall. In the present model study global left-ventricular pump function as expressed in terms of cavity pressure and volume is related to local wall tissue function as expressed in terms of myocardial fiber stress and strain. On the basis of earlier studies in our laboratory, it may be concluded that in the normal left ventricle muscle fiber stress and strain are homogeneously distributed. So, fiber stress and strain may be approximated by single values, being valid for the whole wall. When assuming rotational symmetry and homogeneity of mechanical load in the wall, the dimensionless ratio of muscle fiber stress (sigma f) to left-ventricular pressure (Plv) appears to depend mainly on the dimensionless ratio of cavity volume (Vlv) to wall volume (Vw) and is quite independent of other geometric parameters. A good (+/- 10\%) and simple approximation of this relation is sigma f/Plv = 1 + 3 Vlv/Vw. Natural fiber strain is defined by ef = In (lf/lf,ref), where lf,ref indicates fiber length (lf) in a reference situation. Using the principle of conservation of energy for a change in ef, it holds delta ef = (1/3)delta In (1 + 3Vlv/Vw).},

  abstract = {To determine the effects of a chronic pressure load on cardiac function and morphology, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and two normotensive strains of Wistar rats (WKY and NWR) were studied under ether anesthesia at 13, 25, 52, and 90 wk of age. Although resting cardiac index of the SHR was comparable to that of WKY and NWR at all ages, the peak cardiac output and peak stroke volume per gram of left ventricle determined during a rapid intravenous infusion of Tyrode solution was markedly reduced in the SHR only at 90 wk of age. Autonomic inhibition did not alter the peak stroke volume attained, but reduced peak cardiac output at all ages in each of the strains. Absolute left ventricular dimensions in the SHR increased out of proportion to body growth, consistent with concentric hypertrophy. As peak pumping ability markedly declined from 52 to 90 wk of age in the SHR, the free wall of the left ventricle greatly thickened whereas the septum remained unchanged. At this time the right ventricle also hypertrophied. This disproportionate thickening of the walls of the left ventricle and the hypertrophy of the right ventricle were reflected in measurements of their fiber diameters. These alterations in ventricular architecture may contribute to the decrease in pumping ability observed in long-standing hypertension.},

  doi = {10.1067/mtc.2001.114939},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Residual stress is the stress (force per unit area) that remains when all external loads (eg, left ventricular chamber and pericardial pressures) are removed. It has been suggested that ventricular volume reduction surgery can reconstitute the residual stress-strain state of the left ventricle. To determine the extent to which residual stress is involved, we used a mathematical (finite element) model to simulate the effect of volume reduction operations on left ventricular stroke volume/end-diastolic pressure (Starling) relationships, as well as on regional distributions of stress in the local muscle fiber direction (fiber stress). METHODS: The nonlinear stress-strain relationship for the diastolic myocardium was anisotropic with respect to the local muscle fiber direction. An elastance model for active fiber stress was incorporated in an axisymmetric geometric model of the dilated, poorly contractile left ventricular wall. RESULTS: When residual stress is implemented in the model simulation of volume reduction operations, the additional decrease in stroke volume at fixed left ventricular end-diastolic pressure is small (10\% volume reduction: 2.0\% at 1 mm Hg and 2.0\% at 20 mm Hg; 20\% volume reduction: 2.2\% at 1 mm Hg and 3.1\% at 20 mm Hg). Furthermore, there is little change in the mean fiber stress throughout the left ventricular wall (10\% volume reduction: +1.0\% at end-diastole and -0.3\% at end-systole; 20\% volume reduction: +2.1\% at end-diastole and -1.0\% at end-systole). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that residual stress produced by volume reduction operations has little effect on left ventricular function and the mean fiber stresses at end-diastole and end-systole.},

We recently developed a cardiac G\&R constitutive model that predicts remodeling in response to elevated hemodynamics loading, and a subsequent reversal of the remodeling process when the loading is reduced. Here, we describe the integration of this G\&R model to an existing strongly coupled electromechanical model of the heart. A separation of timescale between growth deformation and elastic deformation was invoked in this integrated electromechanical-growth heart model. To test our model, we applied the G\&R scheme to simulate the effects of myocardial infarction in a realistic left ventricular (LV) geometry using the finite element method. We also simulate the effects of a novel therapy that is based on alteration of the infarct mechanical properties. We show that our proposed model is able to predict key features that are consistent with experiments. Specifically, we show that the presence of a non-contractile infarct leads to a dilation of the left ventricle that results in a rightward shift of the pressure volume loop. Our model also predicts that G\&R is attenuated by a reduction in LV dilation when the infarct stiffness is increased.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.actbio.2010.07.012},
  abstract = {Repair of load-bearing defects resulting from disease or trauma remains a critical barrier for bone tissue engineering. Calcium phosphate (CaP) scaffolds are among the most extensively studied for this application. However, CaPs are reportedly too weak for use in such defects and, therefore, have been limited to non-load-bearing applications. This paper reviews the compression, flexural and tensile properties of CaPs and CaP/polymer composites for applications in bone replacement and repair. This review reveals interesting trends that have not, to our knowledge, previously been reported. Data are classified as bulk, scaffolds, and composites, then organized in order of decreasing strength. This allows for general comparisons of magnitudes of strength both within and across classifications. Bulk and scaffold strength and porosity overlap significantly and scaffold data are comparable to bone both in strength and porosity. Further, for compression, all composite data fall below those of the bulk and most of the scaffold. Another interesting trend revealed is that strength decreases with increasing beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) content for CaP scaffolds and with increasing CaP content for CaP/polymer composites. The real limitation for CaPs appears not to be strength necessarily, but toughness and reliability, which are rarely characterized. We propose that research should focus on novel ways of toughening CaPs and discuss several potential strategies.},

The resulting aliasing is resolved by exploiting spatiotemporal correlations inherent in dynamic images of natural objects. In this article, a modified k-t SENSE reconstruction approach is presented, which aims at improving the temporal fidelity of first-pass, contrast-enhanced myocardial perfusion images at high accelerations. The proposed technique is based on applying parallel imaging on the training data in order to increase their spatial resolution. At a net acceleration of 5.8 (k-t factor = 8, training profiles = 11) accurate representations of dynamic signal-intensities were achieved. The efficacy of this approach as well as limitations due to noise amplification were investigated in computer simulations and in vivo experiments.},

Using a vectorial representation of damage as internal variables in a phenomenological theory, relationships between the overall stiffness properties and the intensity of damage in the individual modes are determined. These relationships show that the intralaminar damage reduces all elastic moduli for a general orientation of the damage entities (cracks) and changes the initial orthotropic symmetry of a laminate. The interlaminar damage, however, does not change the symmetry but reduces the moduli. Predictions of the elastic moduli changes are compared with experimental results, showing excellent agreement.},

  abstract = {The diastolic function (i.e., blood filling) of the left ventricle (LV) is determined by its capacity for relaxation, or the decay in residual active tension (AT) generated during systole, and its constitutive material properties, or myocardial stiffness. The clinical determination of these two factors (diastolic residual AT and stiffness) is thus essential for assessing LV diastolic function. To quantify these two factors, in our previous work, a novel model-based parameter estimation approach was proposed and successfully applied to multiple cases using clinically acquired motion and invasively measured ventricular pressure data. However, the need to invasively acquire LV pressure limits the wide application of this approach. In this study, we address this issue by analyzing the feasibility of using two kinds of non-invasively available pressure measurements for the purpose of inverse mechanical parameter estimation. The prescription of pressure based on a generic pressure-volume (P-V) relationship reported in literature is first evaluated in a set of 18 clinical cases (10 healthy and 8 diseased), finding reasonable results for stiffness but not for residual active tension. We then investigate the use of non-invasive pressure measures, now available through imaging techniques and limited by unknown or biased offset values. Specifically, three sets of physiologically realistic synthetic data with three levels of diastolic residual active tension (i.e., impaired relaxation capability) are designed to quantify the percentage error in the parameter estimation against the possible pressure offsets within the physiological limits. Maximum errors are quantified as 11 \% for the magnitude of stiffness and 22 \% for AT, with averaged 0.17 kPa error in pressure measurement offset using the state-of-the-art non-invasive pressure estimation method. The main cause for these errors is the limited temporal resolution of clinical imaging data currently available. These results demonstrate the potential feasibility of the estimation diastolic biomarkers with non-invasive assessment of pressure through medical imaging data.},

It enjoys several advantages over traditional histological approaches, including the ability to rapidly measure fiber organization in isolated, perfused, arrested hearts, thereby avoiding fixation and sectioning of artifacts. However, quantitative validation of this MRI method has been lacking. Here, fiber orientations estimated in the same locations in the same heart using both diffusion tensor MRI and histology are compared in a total of two perfused rabbit hearts. Fiber orientations were statistically similar for both methods and differed on average by 12 degrees at any single location. This is similar to the 10 degrees uncertainty in fiber orientation achieved with histology. In addition, imaging studies performed in a total of seven hearts support a level of organization beyond the myofiber, the recently described laminar organization of the ventricular myocardium.},

Several opposing and non-mutually compatible models have been proposed to explain cardiac structure, and these models, although limited, have advanced the study and understanding of heart structure, function and development. We describe key areas of similarity and difference, highlight areas of contention and point to the important limitations of these models. Recent research in animal models on the nature, geometry and interaction of cardiac sheet structure allows unification of some seemingly conflicting features of the structural models. Intriguingly, evidence points to significant inter-individual structural variability (within constrained limits) in the canine, leading to the concept of a continuum (or distribution) of cardiac structures. This variability in heart structure partly explains the ongoing debate on myocardial architecture. These developments are used to construct an integrated description of cardiac structure unifying features of fibre, sheet and band architecture that provides a basis for (i) explaining cardiac electromechanics, (ii) computational simulations of cardiac physiology and (iii) designing interventions.},

By conducting a parametric analysis we are able to determine an optimal geometry that increases energy dissipation over 70 times. We discuss the contribution of varying ceramic strengths and size effect to see how this affects the overall performance of the composite. We then compare our simulations to experiments performed on a material possessing the same microstructure investigated computationally. For both simulations and experiments we show that our optimal geometry corresponds to that of natural nacre indicating the importance of specifically incorporating nacre's key morphological and constituent features. This combination of simulations and experiments gives great insight to the delicate interplay between material parameters and microstructure showing that if we optimally combine all aspects, we can develop novel synthetic materials with superior performance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) measures the magnitudes and directions of intramyocardial water diffusion. Assuming the cross-myocyte components to be constrained by the laminar microstructures of myocardium, we hypothesized that cDTI at two cardiac phases might identify any abnormalities of laminar orientation and mobility in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS: We performed cDTI in vivo at 3 Tesla at end-systole and late diastole in 11 healthy controls and 11 patients with HCM, as well as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) for detection of regional fibrosis. RESULTS: Voxel-wise analysis of diffusion tensors relative to left ventricular coordinates showed expected transmural changes of myocardial helix-angle, with no significant differences between phases or between HCM and control groups. In controls, the angle of the second eigenvector of diffusion (E2A) relative to the local wall tangent plane was larger in systole than diastole, in accord with previously reported changes of laminar orientation. HCM hearts showed higher than normal global E2A in systole (63.9$^\circ$ vs 56.4$^\circ$ controls, p = 0.026) and markedly raised E2A in diastole (46.8$^\circ$ vs 24.0$^\circ$ controls, p $\backslash$textless 0.001). In hypertrophic regions, E2A retained a high, systole-like angulation even in diastole, independent of LGE, while regions of normal wall thickness did not (LGE present 57.8$^\circ$, p = 0.0028, LGE absent 54.8$^\circ$, p = 0.0022 vs normal thickness 38.1$^\circ$). CONCLUSIONS: In healthy controls, the angles of cross-myocyte components of diffusion were consistent with previously reported transmural orientations of laminar microstructures and their changes with contraction. In HCM, especially in hypertrophic regions, they were consistent with hypercontraction in systole and failure of relaxation in diastole. Further investigation of this finding is required as previously postulated effects of strain might be a confounding factor.},

  abstract = {The influence of variations of fiber direction on the distribution of stress and strain in the left ventricular wall was investigated using a finite element model to simulate the mechanics of the left ventricle. The commonly modelled helix fiber angle was defined as the angle between the local circumferential direction and the projection of the fiber path on the plane perpendicular to the local radial direction. In the present study, an additional angle, the transverse fiber angle, was used to model the continuous course of the muscle fibers between the inner and the outer layers of the ventricular wall. This angle was defined as the angle between the circumferential direction and the projection of the fiber path on the plane perpendicular to the local longitudinal direction. First, a reference simulation of left ventricular mechanics during a cardiac cycle was performed, in which the transverse angle was set to zero. Next, we performed two simulations in which the spatial distribution of either the transverse or the helix angle was varied with respect to the reference situation, the spatially averaged variations being about 3 and 14$^\circ$, respectively. The changes in fiber orientation hardly affected the pressure-volume relation of the ventricle, but significantly affected the spatial distribution of active muscle fiber stress (up to 50\% change) and sarcomere length (up to 0.1 $\mu$m change). In the basal and apical region of the wall, shear deformation in the circumferential-radial plane was significantly reduced by introduction of a nonzero transverse angle. Thus, the loading of the passive tissue may be reduced by the endocardial-epicardial crossover of the muscle fibers.},

  abstract = {In the study of stresses and strains in vascular segments, it is generally assumed that the traction-free configuration assumed by a segment when there is no axial force and there are no intravascular and extravascular pressures is stress-free. To investigate the degree of validity of this assumption, 286 oval shaped rings were excised from three bovine and six porcine aortas and photographed. Radial cuts were made in these rings which opened up into horseshoe shapes and were also photographed. Smoothed boundary lengths at intimal and adventitial levels in the rings and their cut open configurations were measured from the photographs and the residual strains in the annular configuration relative to the open configuration were computed. It was found that: the average maximum residual intimal engineering strain in the uncut configuration was -0.082 for all nine aortas and -0.096 and -0.077 for the bovine and porcine aortas alone, respectively; the average maximum residual adventitial strain was 0.085 for all aortas, and 0.102 and 0.078 for the bovine and porcine aortas alone, respectively; an estimated average beneficial compressive stress of -0.188 X 10(5) Pa (corresponding to a strain level of -0.082) is available at the intimal level to counteract the in vivo tensile stress due to the intravascular pressure; an estimated average initial tensile stress of 0.195 X 10(5) Pa (corresponding to a strain level of 0.085) exists at the adventitial level which adds to the in vivo tensile stress due to the intravascular pressure. Although these stress levels are not large in comparison with the in vivo stress in the arterial wall, a detailed stress analysis must take into account these initial stresses.},

  abstract = {All previous studies of residual strain in the ventricular wall have been based on one- or two-dimensional measurements. Transmural distributions of three-dimensional (3-D) residual strains were measured by biplane radiography of columns of lead beads implanted in the midanterior free wall of the canine left ventricle (LV). 3-D bead coordinates were reconstructed with the isolated arrested LV in the zero-pressure state and again after local residual stress had been relieved by excising a transmural block of tissue. Nonhomogeneous 3-D residual strains were computed by finite element analysis. Mean +/- SD (n = 8) circumferential residual strain indicated that the intact unloaded myocardium was prestretched at the epicardium (0.07 +/- 0.06) and compressed in the subendocardium (-0.04 +/- 0.05). Small but significant longitudinal shortening and torsional shear residual strains were also measured. Residual fiber strain was tensile at the epicardium (0.05 +/- 0.06) and compressive in the subendocardium (-0.01 +/- 0.04), with residual extension and shortening, respectively, along structural axes parallel and perpendicular to the laminar myocardial sheets. Relatively small residual shear strains with respect to the myofiber sheets suggest that prestretching in the plane of the myocardial laminae may be a primary mechanism of residual stress in the LV.},

  abstract = {Residual strains were measured in the porcine aorta. Segments were cut from the aorta perpendicular to its longitudinal axis. Microdots of water-insoluble black ink were sprinkled onto the transverse sectional surface of the segments in the no-load state. The segments were then cut radially, and sectional zero-stress states were approached. The coordinates of selected microdots (2-20 microns) were digitized from photographs taken in the no-load state and the zero-stress state. Residual strains in the transverse section were calculated from the displacement of the microdots. The circumferential residual strains on the inner wall and outer wall were calculated from the circumferential lengths in the no-load state and the zero-stress state. Results show that the circumferential residual strain is negative (compressive) in the inner layer of the aortic wall and positive (tensile) in the outer layer, whereas the radial residual strain is tensile in the inner layer and compressive in the outer layer. This residual strain distribution reduces the stress concentration in the aorta under physiological load. The experimental results compared well with theoretical estimations of a cylindrical model. Regional difference of the residual strain exists and is significant (P $\backslash$textless 0.01), e.g., the circumferential residual strains on the inner wall of the ascending, descending thoracic, and abdominal regions of the aorta are -0.133 +/- 0.019, -0.074 +/- 0.020, and -0.046 +/- 0.017 (mean +/- SD), respectively. More radial cuts of a segment produced no significant additional strains. This means that an aortic segment after one radial cut can be considered as the zero-stress state.},

  abstract = {Numerous experimental studies have established that cells can sense the stiffness of underlying substrates and have quantified the effect of substrate stiffness on stress fibre formation, focal adhesion area, cell traction, and cell shape. In order to capture such behaviour, the current study couples a mixed mode thermodynamic and mechanical framework that predicts focal adhesion formation and growth with a material model that predicts stress fibre formation, contractility, and dissociation in a fully 3D implementation. Simulations reveal that SF contractility plays a critical role in the substrate-dependent response of cells. Compliant substrates do not provide sufficient tension for stress fibre persistence, causing dissociation of stress fibres and lower focal adhesion formation. In contrast, cells on stiffer substrates are predicted to contain large amounts of dominant stress fibres. Different levels of cellular contractility representative of different cell phenotypes are found to alter the range of substrate stiffness that cause the most significant changes in stress fibre and focal adhesion formation. Furthermore, stress fibre and focal adhesion formation evolve as a cell spreads on a substrate and leading to the formation of bands of fibres leading from the cell periphery over the nucleus. Inhibiting the formation of FAs during cell spreading is found to limit stress fibre formation. The predictions of this mutually dependent material-interface framework are strongly supported by experimental observations of cells adhered to elastic substrates and offer insight into the inter-dependent biomechanical processes regulating stress fibre and focal adhesion formation.},

The framework accounts for the evolution of the underlying microstructure, including particle rotation, which results from the finite changes in geometry that are induced by the applied loading. In turn, the evolution of the microstructure can have a significant geometric softening (or hardening) effect on the overall response, leading to the possible development of macroscopic instabilities through loss of strong ellipticity of the homogenized incremental moduli. The theory is based on a recently developed ``second-order'' homogenization method, which makes use of information on both the first and second moments of the fields in a suitably chosen ``linear comparison composite,'' and generates fairly explicit estimates\textemdash{}linearizing properly\textemdash{}for the large-deformation effective response of the reinforced elastomers.

As the use of late enhancement imaging has matured and the span of applications has widened, the demands on image quality have grown. The characterization of subendocardial MI now includes the accurate quantification of scar size, shape, and characterization of borders which have been shown to have prognostic significance. More diverse patterns of late enhancement including patchy, mid-wall, subepicardial, or diffuse enhancement are of interest in diagnosing nonischemic cardiomyopathies. As clinicians are examining late enhancement images for more subtle indication of fibrosis, the demand for lower artifacts has increased. A range of new techniques have emerged to improve the speed and quality of late enhancement imaging including: methods for acquisition during free breathing, and fat water separated imaging for characterizing fibrofatty infiltration and reduction of artifacts related to the presence of fat. Methods for quantification of T1 and extracellular volume fraction are emerging to tackle the issue of discriminating globally diffuse fibrosis from normal healthy tissue which is challenging using conventional late enhancement methods. The aim of this review will be to describe the current state of the art and to provide a guide to various clinical protocols that are commonly used.},

The proposed constitutive equation is able to exhibit irreversible strain components exclusively governed by the anisotropic damage process without any reference to the classical plastic or viscoplastic phenomena. The four order damage tensor is chosen as symmetric and non-diagonal. This is shown to be enough for the correct description of the variation of elastic properties of composite materials, such as the change of sign of some Poisson's ratios exhibited by some initially anisotropic materials.},

  abstract = {In the design of patient specific mathematical models of cardiac mechanics, the lack of patient specific input data leads to default settings of various model parameters. To estimate the potential errors thus introduced, we evaluated changes in predicted mechanics in a model of the left ventricle (LV) induced by changes in geometry, fiber orientation, heterogeneity of passive material behavior and triaxial active stress development. Incorporation of measured heterogeneity of passive stiffness did not affect systolic mechanics. Incorporation of triaxial active stress development did significantly affect systolic mechanics, but knowledge on this mechanism is too limited to draw conclusions. LV geometry variations covering the biological range changed the equatorial distribution of active myofiber stress and shortening by about 10 to 15\%. Similar changes were found by variation of fiber orientation by 8$^\circ$ at maximum. Since this change in orientation is at the edge of the accuracy, with which myofiber orientation can be measured in vitro, and far below the accuracy, obtainable for in vivo measurements, we conclude that the benefit of accounting for patient specific geometry is questionable when using experimental data on fiber orientation. We propose to select myofiber orientation such, that myofiber load is distributed homogeneously across the cardiac wall. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The phase images corresponding to the negative and positive harmonic peaks in k-space are combined before HARP evaluation to eliminate any spurious phase. To validate in vivo, two complementary spatial modulation of magnetization (CSPAMM) data sets were collected for each volunteer and evaluated with conventional HARP, using either the positive or the negative harmonic peak, and with peak-combination HARP. RESULTS: Elimination of phase distortion by peak combination was observed in vitro and in vivo. Improved reproducibility of motion parameters was found with peak-combination HARP. CONCLUSION: With peak-combination HARP, reproducibility of contractile parameters is improved, and consequently, the number of subjects needed to detect statistically significant changes in contractile function can be reduced to one third compared to conventional HARP evaluation.},

Using the framework proposed by one of our researchers, we extensively reviewed experimental literature, to quantitatively characterize the binding of Ca2+ to TnC, the kinetics of tropomyosin, the availability of binding sites, and the kinetics of crossbridge binding after perturbations in sarcomere length. Model parameters were determined from multiple experimental results and modalities (skinned and intact preparations) and model results were validated against data from length step, caged Ca2+, isometric twitches, and the half-time to relaxation with increasing sarcomere length experiments. A factorial analysis found that the [Ca2+]i transient and the unbinding of Ca2+ from TnC were the primary determinants of relaxation, with a fivefold greater effect than that of length-dependent maximum tension and twice the effect of tension-dependent binding of Ca2+ to TnC and length-dependent Ca2+ sensitivity. The affects of the [Ca2+]i transient and the unbinding rate of Ca2+ from TnC were tightly coupled with the effect of increasing either factor, depending on the reference [Ca2+]i transient and unbinding rate.},

  abstract = {In the wide literature devoted to the cardiac structural mechanics, the strain energy proposed by Holzapfel and Ogden exhibits a number of interesting features: it has suitable mathematical properties and it is based on few material parameters that can, in principle, be identified by standard laboratory tests. In this work we illustrate the implementation of a numerical solver based on such a model for both the passive and active mechanics of the heart. Moreover we discuss its performance on a few tests that can be regarded as preliminary to the adoption of the Holzapfel\textendash{}Ogden model for a real cardiac simulation. While the passive behavior of the cardiac muscle is modeled as an orthotropic hyperelastic material, the active contraction is here accounted for a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, yielding the so\textendash{}called ``active strain'' approach, a formulation that automatically preserves the ellipticity of the stress tensor and introduces just one extra parameter in the model. We adopt the usual volumetric\textendash{}isochoric decomposition of the stress tensor to obtain a mathematically consistent quasi\textendash{}incompressible version of the material, then the numerical approximation applies to a classical Hu\textendash{}Washizu three fields formulation. After introduction of the tangent problem, we select suitable finite element spaces for the representation of the physical fields. Boundary conditions are prescribed by introduction of a Lagrange multiplier. The robustness and performance of the numerical solver are tested versus a novel benchmark test, for which an exact solution is provided. The curvature data obtained from the free contraction of muscular thin films are used to fit the active contraction parameter.},

  abstract = {Wound healing is a synchronized cascade of chemical, biological, and mechanical phenomena, which act in concert to restore the damaged tissue. An imbalance between these events can induce painful scarring. Despite intense efforts to decipher the mechanisms of wound healing, the role of mechanics remains poorly understood. Here, we establish a computational systems biology model to identify the chemical, biological, and mechanical mechanisms of scar formation. First, we introduce the generic problem of coupled chemo-bio-mechanics. Then, we introduce the model problem of wound healing in terms of a particular chemical signal, inflammation, a particular biological cell type, fibroblasts, and a particular mechanical model, isotropic hyperelasticity. We explore the cross-talk between chemical, biological, and mechanical signals and show that all three fields have a significant impact on scar formation. Our model is the first step toward rigorous multiscale, multifield modeling in wound healing. Our formulation has the potential to improve effective wound management and optimize treatment on an individualized patient-specific basis.},

  abstract = {Finite strain analyses of the left ventricle provide important information on heart function and have the potential to provide insights into the biomechanics of myocardial contractility in health and disease. Systolic dysfunction is the most common cause of heart failure; however, abnormalities of diastolic function also contribute to heart failure, and are associated with conditions including left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetes. The clinical significance of diastolic abnormalities is less well understood than systolic dysfunction, and specific treatments are presently lacking. To obtain qualitative and quantitative information on heart function in diastole, we develop a three-dimensional computational model of the human left ventricle that is derived from noninvasive imaging data. This anatomically realistic model has a rule-based fibre structure and a structure-based constitutive model. We investigate the sensitivity of this comprehensive model to small changes in the constitutive parameters and to changes in the fibre distribution. We make extensive comparisons between this model and similar models that employ different constitutive models, and we demonstrate qualitative and quantitative differences in stress and strain distributions for the different constitutive models. We also provide an initial validation of our model through comparisons to experimental data on stress and strain distributions in the left ventricle.},

  abstract = {A non-invasive method for estimating regional myocardial contractility in vivo would be of great value in the design and evaluation of new surgical and medical strategies to treat and/or prevent infarction-induced heart failure. As a first step towards developing such a method, an explicit finite element (FE) model-based formal optimization of regional myocardial contractility in a sheep with left ventricular (LV) aneurysm was performed using tagged magnetic resonance (MR) images and cardiac catheterization pressures. From the tagged MR images, 3-dimensional (3D) myocardial strains, LV volumes and geometry for the animal-specific 3D FE model of the LV were calculated, while the LV pressures provided physiological loading conditions. Active material parameters (T(max\_B) and T(max\_R)) in the non-infarcted myocardium adjacent to the aneurysm (borderzone) and in myocardium remote from the aneurysm were estimated by minimizing the errors between FE model-predicted and measured systolic strains and LV volumes using the successive response surface method for optimization. The significant depression in optimized T(max\_B) relative to T(max\_R) was confirmed by direct ex vivo force measurements from skinned fiber preparations. The optimized values of T(max\_B) and T(max\_R) were not overly sensitive to the passive material parameters specified. The computation time of less than 5 hours associated with our proposed method for estimating regional myocardial contractility in vivo makes it a potentially very useful clinical tool.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.ijplas.2003.10.002},
  abstract = {This study develops a general consistent and systematic framework for the analysis of heterogeneous media that assesses a strong coupling between rate-dependent plasticity and anisotropic rate-dependent damage for dynamic problems within the framework of thermodynamic laws and gradient theories. The proposed formulation includes thermo-elasto-viscoplasticity (rate-dependent plasticity) with anisotropic thermo-viscodamage (rate-dependent damage); a dynamic yield criterion of a von Mises type and a dynamic damage growth criterion; the associated flow rules; thermal softening; non-linear strain hardening; strain-rate hardening; strain hardening gradients; and strain-rate hardening gradients. Since the material macroscopic thermomechanical response under dynamic loading is governed by different physical mechanisms on the meso- and macroscale levels, the proposed three-dimensional kinematical model is introduced with manifold structure accounting for discontinuous fields of dislocation interactions (plastic flow) and crack and void interactions (damage growth). The gradient theory of rate-independent plasticity and rate-independent damage that incorporates macroscale interstate variables and their higher-order gradients is generalized here for rate-dependent plasticity and rate-dependent damage to properly describe the change in the internal structure and in order to investigate the size effect of statistical inhomogeneity of the evolution-related rate- and temperature dependent materials. The idea of bridging length-scales is made more general and complete by introducing spatial higher-order gradients in the temporal evolution equations of the internal state variables that describe hardening in coupled viscoplasticity and viscodamage models, which are considered here physically and mathematically related to their local counterparts. Furthermore, the constitutive equations for the damaged material are written according to the principle of strain energy equivalence between the virgin material and the damaged material; that is, the damaged material is modeled using the constitutive laws of the effective undamaged material in which the nominal stresses and strains are replaced by their effective ones. In addition, computational issues concerned with the current gradient-dependent formulation of initial-boundary value problems are introduced in a finite element context. A weak (virtual work) formulation of the non-local dynamic viscoplastic and viscodamage conditions is derived, which can serve as a basis for the numerical solution of initial boundary value problems in the sense of the finite element method. Explicit expressions for the generalized tangent stiffness matrix and the generalized nodal forces are given. The model presented in this paper can be considered as a feasible thermodynamic approach that enables one to derive various coupled gradient viscoplasticity and viscodamage theories by introducing simplifying assumptions.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To establish the correspondence between the two histologically observable and diffusion tensor MRI (DTMRI) measurements of myolaminae orientation for the first time and show that single myolaminar orientations observed in local histology may result from histological artifact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTMRI was performed on six sheep left ventricles (LV), then corresponding direct histological transmural measurements were made within the anterobasal and lateral-equatorial LV. Secondary and tertiary eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor were compared with each of the two locally observable sheet orientations from histology. Diffusion tensor invariants were calculated to compare differences in microstructural diffusive properties between histological locations with one observable sheet population and two observable sheet populations. RESULTS: Mean difference $\pm$ 1SD between DTMRI and histology measured sheet angles was 8$^\circ$ $\pm$ 27$^\circ$. Diffusion tensor invariants showed no significant differences between histological locations with one observable sheet population and locations with two observable sheet populations. CONCLUSION: DTMRI measurements of myolaminae orientations derived from the secondary and tertiary eigenvectors correspond to each of the two local myolaminae orientations observed in histology. Two local sheet populations may exist throughout LV myocardium, and one local sheet population observed in histology may be a result of preparation artifact.},

  doi = {10.1007/BF00123482},
  abstract = {In the series-fibred muscle architecture commonly found in large muscles of mammals and birds, the intrafasciculary-terminating muscle fibres have no direct tendinous attachments. Contractile force produced in these fibres must be transmitted between adjacent muscle fibres via the endomysial connective tissue which separates them. The endomysium is thus an essential mechanical component in such muscles. Studies of motor end-plate banding patterns and the frequent occurrence of tapering ends of fibres within the fascicles of the bovine sternomandibularis muscle show it to be a series-fibred muscle. Sodium hydroxide digestion of fixed samples of this muscle to remove the myofibrillar apparatus revealed the endomysium to be a disordered planar network of mainly curvilinear collagen fibrils. The orientation distribution of the collagen fibrils in the endomysial network was measured by image analysis of scanning electron micrographs. Analysis of endomysial preparations from muscle fixed at sarcomere lengths between 1-4 microns showed that the orientation distribution of collagen fibrils is quantitatively related to muscle length. At rest sarcomere length the collagen fibril network is not completely random, but has a slight circumferential bias. The orientation distribution shows a progressive shift towards the circumferential direction at short sarcomere lengths and towards the longitudinal direction at long sarcomere lengths. The relationship between the number-weighted mean collagen orientation and sarcomere length was compared to two geometric models of network behaviour, the isoareal and constant shape models. Both fitted the data reasonably, although the constant shape model described the rate of change of mean orientation more closely. From fibrous composites theory, the reinforcement efficiency factor, eta, was calculated from the measured collagen fibril orientation distributions. These calculations predict a non-linearly increasing longitudinal tensile modulus for the endomysium with increasing sarcomere length, in agreement with its known non-linear properties, but confirm that the tensile properties of the endomysium are unsuitable for transmission of tensile force from muscle fibres contracting near rest length. This reinforces a previous interpretation that contractile force is transmitted between neighbouring muscle fibres by trans-laminar shear through the endomysium rather than by in-plane tension.},

  abstract = {Cardiac fibers, as well as their local arrangement in laminar sheets, have a complex spatial variation of their orientation that has an important role in mechanical and electrical cardiac functions. In this paper, a statistical atlas of this cardiac fiber architecture is built for the first time using human datasets. This atlas provides an average description of the human cardiac fiber architecture along with its variability within the population. In this study, the population is composed of ten healthy human hearts whose cardiac fiber architecture is imaged ex vivo with DT-MRI acquisitions. The atlas construction is based on a computational framework that minimizes user interactions and combines most recent advances in image analysis: graph cuts for segmentation, symmetric log-domain diffeomorphic demons for registration, and log-Euclidean metric for diffusion tensor processing and statistical analysis. Results show that the helix angle of the average fiber orientation is highly correlated to the transmural depth and ranges from -41$^\circ$ on the epicardium to +66$^\circ$ on the endocardium. Moreover, we find that the fiber orientation dispersion across the population ($\pm$13$^\circ$) is lower than for the laminar sheets ($\pm$31$^\circ$) . This study, based on human hearts, extends previous studies on other mammals with concurring conclusions and provides a description of the cardiac fiber architecture more specific to human and better suited for clinical applications. Indeed, this statistical atlas can help to improve the computational models used for radio-frequency ablation, cardiac resynchronization therapy, surgical ventricular restoration, or diagnosis and followups of heart diseases due to fiber architecture anomalies.},

  abstract = {A model is proposed for stress analysis of the left ventricular wall (LV wall) based on the realistic assumption that the myocardium is essentially composed of fiber elements which carry only axial tension and vary in orientation through the wall. Stress analysis based on such a model requires an extensive study of muscle fiber orientation and curvature through the myocardium. Accordingly, the principal curvatures were studied at a local site near the equator in ten dog hearts rapidly fixed in situ at end diastole and end systole; the fiber orientation for these hearts had already been established in a previous study. The principal radii of curvature were (a) measured by fitting templates to the endocardial and epicardial wall surfaces in the circumferential and longitudinal directions and (b) computed from measured lengths of semiaxes of ellipsoids of revolution representing the LV wall ("ellipsoid" data). The wall was regarded as a tethered set of nested shells, each having a unique fiber orientation. Results indicate the following. (a) Fiber curvature, k, is maximum at midwall at end systole; this peak shifts towards endocardium at end diastole. (b) The pressure or radial stress through the wall decreases more rapidly near the endocardium than near the epicardium at end diastole and at end systole when a constant tension is assumed for each fiber through the wall. (c) At end diastole the curve for the circumferential stress vs. wall thickness is convex with a maximum at midwall. In the longitudinal direction the stress distribution curve is concave with a minimum at midwall. Similar distributions are obtained at end systole when a constant tension is assumed for each fiber through the wall.

  abstract = {In this work, we introduce a modified Holzapfel-Ogden hyperelastic constitutive model for ventricular myocardium that accounts for residual stresses, and we investigate the effects of residual stresses in diastole using a magnetic resonance imaging-derived model of the human left ventricle (LV). We adopt an invariant-based constitutive modelling approach and treat the left ventricular myocardium as a non-homogeneous, fibre-reinforced, incompressible material. Because in vivo images provide the configuration of the LV in a loaded state even in diastole, an inverse analysis is used to determine the corresponding unloaded reference configuration. The residual stress in this unloaded state is estimated by two different methods. One is based on three-dimensional strain measurements in a local region of the canine LV, and the other uses the opening angle method for a cylindrical tube. We find that including residual stress in the model changes the stress distributions across the myocardium and that whereas both methods yield qualitatively similar changes, there are quantitative differences between the two approaches. Although the effects of residual stresses are relatively small in diastole, the model can be extended to explore the full impact of residual stress on LV mechanical behaviour for the whole cardiac cycle as more experimental data become available. In addition, although not considered here, residual stresses may also play a larger role in models that account for tissue growth and remodelling.},

An Eshelby stress is identified as the driving force for growth, in the sense that it appears as the true dissipative thermodynamic force conjugated to the growth rate.

The quasi-unilateral conditions of micro-cracks closure are written on the hydrostatic stress only. Altogether with the consideration of damage laws ensuring a damage rate proportional to the positive part of the strain tensor this is sufficient to model a strongly different behavior due to damage in tension and in compression. A proof of the positivity of the intrinsic dissipation due to such an induced anisotropic damage is given. An efficient scheme for the implementation of the damage model in commercial Finite Element codes is then detailed. and numerical examples of structural failures are given. Plain concrete, reinforced and pre-stressed concrete structures are computed up to high damage level inducing yielding of the reinforcement steels. Local and nonlocal computations are performed. A procedure for the control of rupture is proposed. It is a key point making the computations with anisotropic damage truly efficient.},

  abstract = {This overview addresses the remarkable efficiency of the mammalian heart as a pump of unique capacity to quickly vary output and ejection velocity and its relation to ventricular geometry, fiber architecture, integrity of collagen scaffold and microvasculature and appropriate electrical activation. The unique functional capacity of the ventricle depends critically on the organization of cardiac muscle fibers in layers of counter-wound helices encircling the ventricular cavity in a pattern that allows a special twisting motion during systole and early diastole, essential to the mechanical efficiency of the normal ventricle to eject and suction venous return. The important contribution of advances in imaging techniques is reviewed, especially magnetic resonance with tagging and tensor analysis to define fiber orientation; these measurements are made without the use of implanted devices that can distort structure and even impair function. The impact of loss of optimal fiber orientation and geometry of the ventricle as a result of diseases that cause heart failure is analyzed, along with the possibility of improvement by carefully planned surgical restoration of ventricular geometry. The very encouraging results yielded by these therapeutic strategies are critically dependent on a clear understanding of the relation of structure and function that our analysis attempts to promote. Simultaneously, there is full acknowledgment of the unanswered questions that are inevitable but equally essential to the continuing search that scientific progress depends on.},

  abstract = {In the cardiac left ventricle during systole mechanical load of the myocardial fibers is distributed uniformly. A mechanism is proposed by which control of mechanical load is distributed over many individual control units acting in the environment of the cell. The mechanics of the equatorial region of the left ventricle was modeled by a thick-walled cylinder composed of 6-1500 shells of myocardial fiber material. In each shell a separate control unit was simulated. The direction of the cells was varied so that systolic fiber shortening approached a given optimum of 15\%. End-diastolic sarcomere length was maintained at 2.1 microns. Regional early-systolic stretch and global contractility stimulated growth of cellular mass. If systolic shortening was more than normal the passive extracellular matrix stretched. The design of the load-controlling mechanism was derived from biological experiments showing that cellular processes are sensitive to mechanical deformation. After simulating a few hundred adaptation cycles, the macroscopic anatomical arrangement of helical pathways of the myocardial fibers formed automatically. If pump load of the ventricle was changed, wall thickness and cavity volume adapted physiologically. We propose that the cardiac anatomy may be defined and maintained by a multitude of control units for mechanical load, each acting in the cellular environment. Interestingly, feedback through fiber stress is not a compelling condition for such control.},

The experimental tests are carried out by in situ X-ray radiography (dynamics of the freezing front) and tomography (morphology of the frozen suspension). The finite element model is a contin- uous properties model; it is used for investigating the dynamics and the shape of the freezing front. The analytical model is based on the two-phase Stefan problem.

These irreversible strains are described without reference to the classical plasticity or viscoplasticity formalism. In the third part, we point out both the necessity and advantages of using a fourth-rank tensor for the description of damage. ``Nondiagonal'' terms are needed in this tensor (D(ijkl)(ij not-equal kl)=0) in order to be able to describe the microscopic phenomena through a macroscopic formulation. The fourth part gives an application of this formalism to a ceramic matrix composite, and shows the advantages of the model.},

  issn = {2335-6936},
  abstract = {In the field of cardiac modeling, calcium- (Ca-) based activation is often described by sets of ordinary differential equations that do not explicitly represent spatial interactions of regulatory proteins or crossbridge attachment. These spatially compressed models are most often mean-field representations as opposed to methods that explicitly compute the surrounding field (or equivalently, the surrounding environment) of individual regulatory units and crossbridges. Instead, a mean value is used to represent the whole population. Almost universally, the mean-field approach assumes developed force produces positive feedback to globally increase the mean binding affinity of the regulatory proteins. We show that this approach produces hysteresis in the steady-state Force-Ca responses when developed force increases Ca-affinity troponin to the degree that is observed in real muscle. Specifically, multiple stable solutions exist as a function of Ca level that could be alternatively reached depending on stimulus history. The resulting hysteresis is quite pronounced and disagrees with experimental characterizations in cardiac muscle that generally show little if any hysteresis. Moreover, we provide data showing that hysteresis does not occur in carefully controlled myofibril preparations. Hence, we suggest that the most widely used methods to produce multiscale models of cardiac force generation show bistability and hysteresis effects that are not seen in real muscle responses},

  abstract = {The difficult challenge of simulating diffuse and complex fracture patterns in tough structural composites is at last beginning to yield to conceptual and computational advances in fracture modeling. Contributing successes include the refinement of cohesive models of fracture and the formulation of hybrid stress-strain and traction-displacement models that combine continuum (spatially averaged) and discrete damage representations in a single calculation. Emerging hierarchical formulations add the potential of tracing the damage mechanisms down through all scales to the atomic. As the models near the fidelity required for their use as virtual experiments, opportunities arise for reducing the number of costly tests needed to certify safety and extending the design space to include material configurations that are too complex to certify by purely empirical methods.},

  volume = {32},
  abstract = {Existing magnetic resonance methods for diffusion imaging, including echo planar, are ineffective in the beating heart due to motion-induced signal attenuation. To overcome this problem, we used a diffusion-weighted stimulated echo-echo planar magnetic resonance imaging sequence. The two lobes of the diffusion-sensitizing gradient were synchronized to the same point in successive cardiac cycles in order to fix the cardiac position and avoid bulk motion effects. The apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of the interventricular septum in 12 healthy subjects for diffusion gradients along the x-, y-, and z-directions were 1.40 +/- 0.27, 1.48 +/- 0.35, and 1.78 +/- 0.27 x 10(-3) mm2/s. The ADCs of the interventricular septum in a second group of 15 healthy subjects for diffusion gradients along the short axis, horizontal and vertical long axes were 0.92 +/- 0.15, 1.50 +/- 0.15, and 1.10 +/- 0.24 x 10(-3) mm2/s. Because the ADCs were less than the measured values for skeletal muscle and their standard deviations were low, it seems unlikely that bulk motion effects made the dominant contribution to the measured myocardial ADC for the interventricular septum, although motion and/or susceptibility artifacts frequently degraded measurements in the free wall of the left ventricle. Additional evidence that ADC was not predominantly determined by wall motion was obtained in a third group of patients with various cardiac abnormalities, in whom there was only a weak correlation between ADC and ejection fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.},

The most basic strategy consists in determining a value of the load increment that ensures the convergence of the solution with respect to time on the base of preliminary simulations. In more advanced applications, the load increments can be controlled for instance by prescribing the number of iterations of the non-linear resolution procedure, or by using an arc-length algorithm. These techniques usually introduce a parameter whose correct value is not easy to obtain. In this paper, an alternative procedure is proposed. It is based on the continuous control of the residual of the reference problem over time, whose measure is easy to interpret. This idea is applied in the framework of a multiscale domain decomposition strategy in order to perform 3D delamination analysis.},

  abstract = {An acute myocardial infarction, particularly one that is large and transmural, can produce alterations in the topography of both the infarcted and noninfarcted regions of the ventricle. This remodeling can importantly affect the function of the ventricle and the prognosis for survival. In the early period, infarct expansion has been recognized by echocardiography as a lengthening of the noncontractile region. The noninfarcted region also undergoes an important lengthening that is consistent with a secondary volume-overload hypertrophy and that can be progressive. The extent of ventricular enlargement after infarction is related to the magnitude of the initial damage to the myocardium and, although an increase in cavity size tends to restore stroke volume despite a persistently depressed ejection fraction, ventricular dilation has been associated with a reduction in survival. The process of ventricular enlargement can be influenced by three interdependent factors, that is, infarct size, infarct healing, and ventricular wall stresses. A most effective way to prevent or minimize the increase in ventricular size after infarction and the consequent adverse effect on prognosis is to limit the initial insult. Acute reperfusion therapy has been consistently shown to result in a reduction in ventricular volume. The reestablishment of blood flow to the infarcted region, even beyond the time frame for myocyte salvage, has beneficial effects in attenuating ventricular enlargement. The process of scarification can be interfered with during the acute infarct period by the administration of glucocorticosteroids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, which result in thinner infarcts and greater degrees of infarct expansion. Modification of distending or deforming forces can importantly influence ventricular enlargement. Even short-term augmentations in afterload have deleterious long-term effects on ventricular topography. Conversely, judicious use of nitroglycerin seems to be associated with an attenuation of infarct expansion and long-term improvement in clinical outcome. Long-term therapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor can favorably alter the loading conditions on the left ventricle and reduce progressive ventricular enlargement as demonstrated in both experimental and clinical studies. With the former therapy, this attenuation of ventricular enlargement was associated with a prolongation in survival. The long-term clinical consequences of long-t$\backslash$ldots},

  abstract = {Cells change their form and function by assembling actin stress fibers at their base and exerting traction forces on their extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions. Individual stress fibers are thought to be actively tensed by the action of actomyosin motors and to function as elastic cables that structurally reinforce the basal portion of the cytoskeleton; however, these principles have not been directly tested in living cells, and their significance for overall cell shape control is poorly understood. Here we combine a laser nanoscissor, traction force microscopy, and fluorescence photobleaching methods to confirm that stress fibers in living cells behave as viscoelastic cables that are tensed through the action of actomyosin motors, to quantify their retraction kinetics in situ, and to explore their contribution to overall mechanical stability of the cell and interconnected ECM. These studies reveal that viscoelastic recoil of individual stress fibers after laser severing is partially slowed by inhibition of Rho-associated kinase and virtually abolished by direct inhibition of myosin light chain kinase. Importantly, cells cultured on stiff ECM substrates can tolerate disruption of multiple stress fibers with negligible overall change in cell shape, whereas disruption of a single stress fiber in cells anchored to compliant ECM substrates compromises the entire cellular force balance, induces cytoskeletal rearrangements, and produces ECM retraction many microns away from the site of incision; this results in large-scale changes of cell shape ($\backslash$textgreater 5\% elongation). In addition to revealing fundamental insight into the mechanical properties and cell shape contributions of individual stress fibers and confirming that the ECM is effectively a physical extension of the cell and cytoskeleton, the technologies described here offer a novel approach to spatially map the cytoskeletal mechanics of living cells on the nanoscale.},

This paper proposes to overcome these problems by considering the fluid and the structure as a unique continuous medium, to be studied in a fixed reference configuration, The resulting problem is then split into a fluid and a structural part through an additive decomposition of the space of kinematically admissible test functions. This approach treats the structure in a fully Lagrangian way and uses an associated arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation for the fluid. Such a strategy has three advantages which are detailed in the present paper. . it can be discretised in time by implicit, stable. energy conserving time integration schemes, and solved by simple, iterative uncoupled algorithms; . the fluid and the structural problems can be approximated by independent finite element spaces; . the most recent geometrically exact nonlinear shell models can be used for the structures. The full strategy has been implemented into an industrial CFD code. Results obtained in the simulation of industrial hydraulic shock absorbers are presented at the end of the paper.

  doi = {10.3233/THC-120710},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Left ventricular myocytes are arranged in a complex three-dimensional mesh. Since all myocytes contract approximately to the same degree, mechanisms must exist to enable force transfer from each of these onto the framework as a whole, despite the transmural differences in deformation strain. This process has hitherto not been clarified in detail. OBJECTIVE: To present a geometrical model that establishes a mechanical link between the three-dimensional architecture and the function of the left ventricular myocardium. METHODS: The left ventricular equator was modeled as a cylindrical tube of deformable but incompressible material, composed of virtual cardiomyocytes with known diastolic helical and transmural angles. By imposing reference circumferential, longitudinal, and torsional strains onto the model, we created a three-dimensional deformation field to calculate passive shortening of the myocyte surrogates. We tested two diastolic architectures: 1) a simple model with longitudinal myocyte surrogates in the endo- and epicardium, and circular ones in the midwall, and 2) a more accurate architecture, with progressive helical angle distribution varying from -60$^\circ$ in the epicardium to 60$^\circ$ in the endocardium, with or without torsion and transmural cardiomyocyte angulation. RESULTS: The simple model caused great transmural unevenness in cardiomyocyte shortening; longitudinal surrogates shortened by 15\% at all depths equal to the imposed longitudinal strain, whereas circular surrogates exhibited a maximum shortening of 23.0\%. The accurate model exhibited a smooth transmural distribution of cardiomyocyte shortening, with a mean (range) of 17.0 (13.2-20.8)\%. Torsion caused a shortening of 17.0 (15.2-18.9)\% and transmural angulation caused a shortening of 15.2 (12.4-18.2)\%. Combining the effects of transmural angulation and torsion caused a change of 15.2 (13.2-16.5)\%. CONCLUSION: A continuous transmural distribution of the helical angle is obligatory for smooth shortening of the cardiomyocytes, but a combination of torsional and transmural angulation changes is necessary to execute systolic mural thickening whilst keeping shortening of the cardiomyocytes within its physiological range.},

The objective of this study was to assess the influence of particle size on the solidification behavior of the suspensions during the early stages of solidification. Four powders with particle size in the range of 0.2\textendash{}3.4 lm (median size) were investigated. Solidification is obtained by cooling at a constant rate, starting fromroom temperature. Attention is specifically paid to the nucleation and growth behavior of the ice crystals in these suspensions. We propose that the nucleation of ice crystals is controlled by the particle size, the surface of the particles acting as nucleation sites. Smaller particle size leads to a lower degree of supercooling because nucleation and growth can proceed at a higher temperature than with larger particles. The initial interface velocity is dependent on the degree of supercooling, and controls the extent of the initial structural gradient in the resulting porous materials.},

The electromechanics-growth model couples biophysically detailed cellular-based laws that describe the short term events occurring in the excitation-contraction coupling process in the cardiomyocytes, to a phenomenological law that describes the long-term process of growth and remodeling in the cardiac tissue. Two clinically relevant phases depicting the progression and subsequent treatment of heart failure were simulated using this model. These phases are namely, (1) the long-term remodeling process induced by a myocardial infarction and (2) the long-term response following regeneration of the infarct. Our model predictions show that the abnormal myofiber strain values surrounding the infarct can drive the post-infarct LV hypertrophy, whereas a subsequent normalization of the myofiber strain after infarct regeneration can lead to a reduction in the LV size. These findings are consistent with some of the observations found in the experiments and clinical studies of cardiac regenerative therapies.},

Although the compressible Euler/Navier-Stokes equations cover all effects, an approximation via standard compressible solvers does not have the ability to represent acoustic waves correctly. Therefore, different methods have been developed to deal with the problem. In this paper, three of them are considered and compared to each other. They are the Multiple Pressure Variables Approach (MPV), the Expansion about Incom- pressible Flow (EIF) and a coupling method via heterogeneous domain decomposition. In the latter approach, the non-linear Euler equations are used in a domain as small as possible to cover the sound generation, and the locally linearized Euler equations approximated with a high-order scheme are used in a second domain to deal with the sound propagation. Comparisons will be given in construction principles as well as implementational effort and computational costs on actual numerical examples.},

A displacement-pressure mixed formulation is combined with a penalty method to enforce the quasi-incompressible constraint without locking. Numerical examples are presented and compared to known solutions; further examples present practical applications of this research to active problems in elastomeric component design.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To apply the low-rank plus sparse (L+S) matrix decomposition model to reconstruct undersampled dynamic MRI as a superposition of background and dynamic components in various problems of clinical interest. THEORY AND METHODS: The L+S model is natural to represent dynamic MRI data. Incoherence between k-t space (acquisition) and the singular vectors of L and the sparse domain of S is required to reconstruct undersampled data. Incoherence between L and S is required for robust separation of background and dynamic components. Multicoil L+S reconstruction is formulated using a convex optimization approach, where the nuclear norm is used to enforce low rank in L and the l1 norm is used to enforce sparsity in S. Feasibility of the L+S reconstruction was tested in several dynamic MRI experiments with true acceleration, including cardiac perfusion, cardiac cine, time-resolved angiography, and abdominal and breast perfusion using Cartesian and radial sampling. RESULTS: The L+S model increased compressibility of dynamic MRI data and thus enabled high-acceleration factors. The inherent background separation improved background suppression performance compared to conventional data subtraction, which is sensitive to motion. CONCLUSION: The high acceleration and background separation enabled by L+S promises to enhance spatial and temporal resolution and to enable background suppression without the need of subtraction or modeling.

  abstract = {Numerical simulations that incorporate a biochemomechanical model for the contractility of the cytoskeleton have been used to rationalize the following observations. Uniaxial cyclic stretching of cells causes stress fibers to align perpendicular to the stretch direction, with degree of alignment dependent on the stretch strain magnitude, as well as the frequency and the transverse contraction of the substrate. Conversely, equibiaxial cyclic stretching induces a uniform distribution of stress fiber orientations. Demonstrations that the model successfully predicts the alignments experimentally found are followed by a parameter study to investigate the influence of a range of key variables including the stretch magnitude, the intrinsic rate sensitivity of the stress fibers, the straining frequency, and the transverse contraction of the substrate. The primary predictions are as follows. The rate sensitivity has a strong influence on alignment, equivalent to that attained by a few percent of additional stretch. The fiber alignment increases with increasing cycling frequency. Transverse contraction of the substrate causes the stress fibers to organize into two symmetrical orientations with respect to the primary stretch direction.},

Specifically, Al(2)O(3)/Al-Si laminates with ceramic contents up to approximately 40 vol\% and with lamellae thicknesses down to 10 microm were processed and characterized. These structures achieve an excellent fracture toughness of 40 MPa radicalm at a tensile strength of approximately 300 MPa.

  title = {Rupture Time under Creep Conditions},
  volume = {2},
  abstract = {The problem of long time strength (evaluation of time to rupture) is of obvious relevance for various machine parts working under high temperature conditions. The existing data on specimens tested under uniaxial tension are insufficient for general loading conditions and inhomogeneous stress states: intensive experimental investigations are being conducted in this direction. Theoretical modelling of long time strength in the framework of continuum mechanics appears to be important. In recently published work of Hoff (1953), the moment of failure of a rod under tension is defined as the one at which the cross-sectional area becomes zero as a result of quasiviscous flow. His result is in satisfactory agreement with experimental data. A similar concept was used by Katz (1957) and by Rosenblum (1957) in their studies of times to rupture of thick-walled pipes and of a rotating disk with a hole. We note, however, that the experimental data points typically lie below the theoretical predictions and that rupture occurs at elongations not exceeding several tens per cent. The concept of Hoff has certain limitations. It predicts, for example, that creep under torsion does not result in rupture, contrary to observations. Also, his scheme does not explain fractures at small strains (`brittle' ruptures) and the change of character of rupture (from `viscous' to `brittle') if the material is not sufficiently stable. Here, we suggest a theoretical model for the time to rupture with the account of embrittlement. We emphasize that the physics of such phenomena is very complex and has not been studied sufficiently. Although we discuss microcracking, the results can be interpreted in a more general way, in terms of development of damage.},

The technique was implemented on a 0.38-T imager and tested on phantoms and volunteers. In humans, tags could be seen 60-450 msec after RF saturation, thus permitting sampling of the entire contractile phase of the cardiac cycle. Tagged regions appear as hypointense stripes, and their patterns of displacement reflect intervening cardiac motion. In addition to simple translation and rotation, complex motions such as cardiac twist can be demonstrated. The effects of RF pulse angle, relaxation times, and heart rate on depiction of the tagged region are discussed.},

Specimens were obtained from 18 dog hearts rapidly fixed in situ in systole, in diastole, and in dilated diastole. Fiber orientation was determined across the free wall at eight sites from a T-shaped specimen by measurements with light microscopy in serial paraffin sections. Results indicate: (1) The wall has a well-ordered distribution of fiber angles varying from about 60\{degrees\} (from the circumferential direction) at the inner surface to about -60\{degrees\} on the outer surface. The greatest change in angle with respect to wall thickness occurs at the two surfaces (endocardial and epicardial). (2) Fiber angles did not change significantly during the transition from diastole to systole, despite a 28\% increase in wall thickness (except in the papillary muscle root region). (3) The proportion of fibers lying in the sector of fiber angles oriented circumferentially (0\{+/-\}22.5\{degrees\}) to those oriented longitudinally (67.5 to 90\{degrees\} and -67.5 to -90\{degrees\}) is approximately 10:1. This ratio increases toward the base and diminishes toward the apex of the left ventricle. (4) All fiber angles in the lateral wall of hearts in systole increased through the wall by approximately 7\{degrees\} near the base and 19\{degrees\} near the apex relative to their counterparts in diastole, indicating bending or torsion of the left ventricle during contraction.},

Samples (3 x 3 x 3 mm) were cut from adjacent regions of the lateral left ventricular midwall, with sides aligned with the principal material axes. Four cycles of sinusoidal simple shear (maximum shear displacements of 0.1-0.5) were applied separately to each specimen in two orthogonal directions. Resulting forces along the three axes were measured. Three specimens from each heart were tested in different orientations to cover all six modes of simple shear deformation. Passive myocardium has nonlinear viscoelastic shear properties with reproducible, directionally dependent softening as strain is increased. Shear properties were clearly anisotropic with respect to the three principal material directions: passive ventricular myocardium is least resistant to simple shear displacements imposed in the plane of the myocardial layers and most resistant to shear deformations that produce extension of the myocyte axis. Comparison of results for the six different shear modes suggests that simple shear deformation is resisted by elastic elements aligned with the microstructural axes of the tissue.},

  abstract = {The mechanical properties of healing myocardial infarcts are a critical determinant of pump function and the transition to heart failure. Recent reports suggest that modifying infarct mechanical properties can improve function and limit ventricular remodeling. However, little attempt has been made to identify the specific infarct material properties that would optimize left ventricular (LV) function. We utilized a finite-element model of a large anteroapical infarct in a dog heart to explore a wide range of infarct mechanical properties. Isotropic stiffening of the infarct reduced end-diastolic (EDV) and end-systolic (ESV) volumes, improved LV contractility, but had little effect on stroke volume. A highly anisotropic infarct, with high longitudinal stiffness but low circumferential stiffness coefficients, produced the best stroke volume by increasing diastolic filling, without affecting contractility or ESV. Simulated infarcts in two different locations displayed different transmural strain patterns. Our results suggest that there is a general trade-off between acutely reducing LV size and acutely improving LV pump function, that isotropically stiffening the infarct is not the only option of potential therapeutic interest, and that customizing therapies for different infarct locations may be important. Our model results should provide guidance for design and development of therapies to improve LV function by modifying infarct mechanical properties.},

  abstract = {Highly porous ceramics are critical components of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells. Nevertheless, their mechanical properties are poor and not fully understood. Herein, Discrete Element simulations are used to quantitatively assess the relation between the particulate microstructure of highly porous ceramics and their mechanical properties. Partially sintered ceramics are numerically generated with complex microstructures including pore formers and bilayers. These microstructures are then tested in tension and compression to obtain their elastic and fracture behavior. Compiling experimental data from the literature and simulations results, an Orowan-Petch type relation between strength and particle size is proposed for highly porous ceramics. It is based on the local fracture model at the length scale of solid bonds between sintered particles.},

  volume = {113},
  issn = {1524-4539},
  doi = {10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.571455},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mechanical dyssynchrony is a potential means to predict response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). We hypothesized that novel echocardiographic image speckle tracking can quantify dyssynchrony and predict response to CRT. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-four subjects were studied: 64 heart failure patients undergoing CRT (aged 64+/-12 years, ejection fraction 26+/-6\%, QRS duration 157+/-28 ms) and 10 normal controls. Speckle tracking applied to routine midventricular short-axis images calculated radial strain from multiple circumferential points averaged to 6 standard segments. Dyssynchrony from timing of speckle-tracking peak radial strain was correlated with tissue Doppler measures in 47 subjects (r=0.94, P$\backslash$textless0.001; 95\% CI 0.90 to 0.96). The ability of baseline speckle-tracking radial dyssynchrony (time difference in peak septal wall-to-posterior wall strain $\backslash$textgreater or =130 ms) to predict response to CRT was then tested. It predicted an immediate increase in stroke volume in 48 patients studied the day after CRT with 91\% sensitivity and 75\% specificity. In 50 patients with long-term follow-up 8+/-5 months after CRT, baseline speckle-tracking radial dyssynchrony predicted a significant increase in ejection fraction with 89\% sensitivity and 83\% specificity. Patients in whom left ventricular lead position was concordant with the site of latest mechanical activation by speckle-tracking radial strain had an increase in ejection fraction from baseline to a greater degree (10+/-5\%) than patients with discordant lead position (6+/-5\%; P$\backslash$textless0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Speckle-tracking radial strain can quantify dyssynchrony and predict immediate and long-term response to CRT and has potential for clinical application.},
